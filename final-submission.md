## Chapter One: Introduction

> Both rhetoric and religion appear to be universal to the human condition. Yet rarely are they correlated in the course of human inquiry. Thus, the rhetoric of religion is an immense undiscovered country. - Margaret D. Zulick, “Rhetoric of Religion: a Map of the Territory,” 125.

It is a Sunday evening in October, and campus at York College sits quiet and dark before a new week of classes. The neighboring church, which plays host to daily chapel and other school events, is mostly dark as well, but in the sanctuary two young men set up a projector screen and place a few trays of unleavened bread and grape juice on the communion table. One can light shines directly upon the table; the rest of the five-hundred-seat sanctuary remains dark.

A little before 9:00, groups of students begin arriving. They talk energetically in the dim foyer, greeting one another if they have been away—it is a small school (less than 500 students) located in a small town (York, Nebraska), and most students know each other—but when they enter the auditorium they hush, and sit closely together.

The service starts with a few hymns, sung *a capella* from words projected on the screen (it’s too dark to read a hymnal): the gospel hymn “I Need Thee Every Hour” and the newer “Lamb of God,” plus a few others. After the singing concludes, the young man who set up communion stands before the table and speaks for ten minutes about wisdom and the pursuit of God. He then prays, invites all to come to the table as they wish, and returns to his seat. There is a pause—not a formal moment of silence but one of those slightly awkward points of transition when a group waits to see who will act first. Then someone from within the congregation starts the hymn “Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing,” and a few others go up to the table as the singing swells.

Gradually, one by one or in small groups, the students go up and take communion, serving themselves directly from the trays. Sometimes they merely partake individually and return to their seats, but frequently two or three students go up together, or meet each other at the front. They pick up their sliver of unleavened bread and their single-serving cups of grape juice and withdraw, together, to the outer, unlighted sections of the auditorium. Into the dark. There, they pray and eat together, while the larger group continues to sing. Some of these gatherings are spontaneous, while other students arrive together intending to share communion in this manner, as a means of reconciliation or to cement a bond of friendship. Conversations in these gatherings tend toward weighty matters of faith and doubt, relationships and family, vocation and purpose.

The spontaneous singing will go on, led by whoever can think of a song, for more than hour. Though all have morning classes on Monday, many will linger late into the evening, especially those huddled together at the fringes of the sanctuary. These students will go on praying together, with embraces and even tears, as the singing continues and the hour grows later.

For most, this evening service will have been the second religious observance of the day, for at this conservative school attendance at Sunday morning worship is the norm, if not the universal practice. Moreover, daily chapel is required and several other devotional opportunities are offered through the week. Nonetheless, many of these students are unwavering in their attendance at “9 o’clock,” as they term the evening service.

What accounts for emotional force of this service, and the loyalty it fosters? What makes it so important in gathering these students to be present to one another? Is it the dimmed lights? The late hour? The pleasure of seeing one another after the weekend? How can we account for the sheer presence created by such an event week in and week out—its intimacy, its sense that something profound has occurred?

### An Undiscovered Country

Let’s consider these questions from another, more general perspective. Religion, despite Friedrich Nietzsche, space travel, cognitive science, deconstruction, Richard Dawkins, gay marriage, and other assorted phenomena supposedly corrosive to its credibility, has not disappeared. Instead, as it has ever been, religion remains one of the most pervasive and influential phenomena in human culture, shaping the vast majority of the figures rhetoricians study, from Plato to Martin Luther King, Jr. to our students, and informing no small portion of human thought and endeavor in other disciplines as well.

Moreover, religion is fundamentally concerned with persuasion, whether of existing adherents or outsiders, depending on the level of evangelical fervor in a given religion. In both the academy and public life, religious questions have recently taken on a new urgency, to the point that there has been some discussion of a “religious turn” in literary studies, with an accompanying level of energy in both theoretical and applied scholarship.[^1] Given these facts, and the religiosity of many historical figures in rhetoric (Augustine, Erasmus, John Henry Newman, Phoebe Palmer, among many others), we must ask whether discussion of religion in rhetorical studies is really adequate.

Although numerous recent rhetorical considerations of sacred rhetoric can be found, Margaret D. Zulick’s assessment of the rhetoric of religion as an “immense undiscovered country” bears consideration (125). Zulick observes that much of the scholarship on the rhetoric of religion is narrowly limited in scope, confined to relatively few areas. Although studies of rhetoric in the Hebrew Bible or American religious culture abound, as Zulick notes, this work inevitably draws its methodology and critical framework not from a robust understanding of sacred rhetoric itself, but from general critical and cultural theory, Aristotelian rhetoric, or some other area of the field. It is in this sense that the rhetoric of religion is an “undiscovered country”—few scholars have attempted to work on the subject in anything but a narrowly topical and applied sense. Kenneth Burke’s essential *The Rhetoric of Religion* from 1961 is of course the most notable exception. That text has its problems and oddities—which I will assess in the next chapter—but it undoubtedly offers the field a richly theorized understanding of sacred rhetoric. Valuable as it is, however, Burke’s single work on sacred rhetoric can hardly have exhausted the possibility of the subject. Yet on Zulick’s account, theoretical work on sacred rhetoric after Burke has been sparse. After Burke, the field has largely been taken up with analysis or deployment of Burke himself, along with studies centered around the specialized questions of particular periods and national literatures rather than a consideration of sacred rhetoric as such.[^2] Indeed, much scholarship in “the rhetoric of religion” is not construed as scholarship on sacred rhetoric at all, but rather as scholarship on medieval rhetoric, biblical literature, or American political culture. Whereas the rhetoric of science, for instance, rises to the level of a subdiscipline, the rhetoric of religion lacks coherence and a theoretical agenda, instead taking place in a handful of scattered monographs, articles, and series, each operating in their own sphere.

Within the history of rhetoric, religion appears only infrequently, as an occasional interloper rather than a major conversation partner with rhetoric. This does not signal a universally insular attitude in rhetorical studies, however. Rhetoricians are constantly in dialogue with other disciplines, most notably in their ongoing dissent against philosophy. Not infrequently, the history of rhetoric simply *is* the story of its conflict with philosophy, as in Samuel IJsseling’s well-known telling. Deborah K. Shuger finds this story in Stanley Fish, for whom philosophy lies on the side of the True and the Good and rhetoric on the side of emotion and practical victory, with no concern for truth or responsibility (47). Fish sees the struggle between philosophy’s desire for truth and rhetoric’s desire for victory as an eternal conflict, and cheerfully aligns himself with rhetoric. For Shuger, this account implies three things about “what Fish calls ‘Western thought’: that it viewed rhetoric as basically another name for sophistry; that it considered the emotions to be *sub*rational; and that it identified dispassionate, objective inquiry with the pursuit of both Truth and Goodness” (48, emphasis original). Shuger describes these assumptions as the basis of the postmodern story of history, that opposes the hegemonic philosophical forces of rationality and truth against the subversive and emotive play of rhetoric.

Although she does not deny that many thinkers hold to these views, she argues that this story “cannot account for the ethical and epistemic bases of early modern sacred rhetoric” (48). Drawing on a deep knowledge of oft-neglected figures like the sixteenth-century Spanish humanist Juan Luis Vives, Shuger demonstrates that religious rhetoric in the early modern period promoted a view of the emotions as integral to the pursuit of truth and goodness. Christian rhetoricians in the early modern period promoted a richly rhetorical style full of emotional language, rather than a more plain and rational philosophical style, in keeping with a search for “passionate knowledge” (54). Since religious truth concerning the state of one’s soul *ought* to affect the emotions, these thinkers sought to promulgate a rhetorical style that drew the emotions into the search for truth. Shuger notes that while early modern rhetoricians like Ludovico Carbo and Nicholas Caussin dismissed sophistry, they did so not on the grounds of a search for truth, but because they saw its self-conscious playfulness as in fact limiting true passion. For Carbo, true sacred rhetoric aims not at playfulness but “the commitment and unselfconscious absorption of strong emotion” (49). Sacred rhetoric thus operates outside the rhetoric/philosophy binary with a concern *both* for emotional effectiveness and the pursuit of truth. In short, Shuger argues that rhetoricians who promote the conflict with philosophy as definitive of the discipline have overlooked sacred rhetoric. As my title has it, rhetoricians don’t “get” religion, not because they are irreligious or anti-religious, but because the story we have accepted about our discipline has written religion out of the frame.[^3] If we are to properly grapple with Shuger’s argument, we must write religion back into the history of rhetoric.

If, as in Shuger’s analysis, early modern sacred rhetoricians complicate the rhetoric/philosophy binary—which I’ll henceforth term “the IJsseling story” for syntactical convenience—and suggest a new story of religion in the rhetorical tradition, how much more might sacred rhetoric in other periods add to this account? Might there be other sacred rhetoricians at other times who further show the traditional story to be, at best, too simple? I believe that there are, and so this dissertation aims to carry through Shuger’s analysis of sacred rhetoric to the rest of the history of rhetoric. Given the pervasive acceptance of the IJsseling story, we need this new account not just to give us a firmer grasp of certain neglected historical figures, but to redress the fragmented and atheoretical state of play in the field. Since theorizing sacred rhetoric necessarily takes place within the history of rhetoric, we must “get” religion and its past in the tradition in order to offer a new account of its present and future.

In order to demonstrate the fragmented nature of scholarship on rhetoric and religion, I will now offer a brief survey of efforts to survey or “map” (to use Zulick’s phrase) the rhetoric of religion, whether by outlining areas of study or ways to approach the subject. A look at the few existing attempts to characterize the field as a whole should sufficiently demonstrate my point that the rhetoric of religion lacks focus. Although I will restrict myself to the field of rhetoric and composition as it is known in American universities—my disciplinary home—it should be noted that the situation is similar in related fields, such as communication studies.[^4]

Zulick’s “map of the territory” makes a useful starting point, for it demonstrates the absence of theoretical perspective on the subject other than Burke’s. A treatment of Burke and Burkean scholarship opens Zulick’s description of scholarship on the rhetoric of religion, but the remainder of the subjects she surveys are narrowly topical: biblical rhetoric, rhetoric in the Hebrew Bible, and the deployment of sacred rhetoric in American political discourse. Each area has its own trends and own major figures, yet connections between approaches are sparse and their suitability for a theory of sacred rhetoric at large is dubious. For example, Zulick describes biblical rhetoric as dominated by three methodologies: an “‘antiquarian’ (read Aristotelian)” application of classical rhetoric, a Burkean rhetoric of identification, and an “ideological stance” drawing on the “hermeneutic of suspicion” associated with feminist criticism (Zulick 130-31). Though each of these approaches rewards study in its own right, connections between them do not resolve into a common set of concerns for the study of sacred rhetoric. Rather, each has its own distinctive concerns—a theoretical account of identification, classical topoi, gender justice—which do not readily mesh into a common discourse, nor do they necessarily have to do with the sacred as such.

The situation is similar in other areas Zulick covers, such as American political rhetoric, where she finds scholars emphasizing specific genres (the jeremiad) and movements (the Quakers and Puritans) in order to understand American prophetic discourse (133). Zulick notes that these discussion of prophetic rhetoric in American discourse have little continuity with analysis of biblical prophetic writings. Rhetorical grappling with sacred traditions has lacked a “systematic” treatment, developing instead through “articles scattered throughout the discipline” (135). For Zulick, the respective modes of biblical and American political rhetoric remain in their respective subdisciplinary silos without attempting a much-needed synthesis. Lacking such a synthesis, both areas tend towards particular concerns that have little to do with the sacred as such, but are distinctive to their own period. Without a theory of prophetic rhetoric in general, for instance, good work can be done on biblical or American prophecy, but connections between the historical periods are more elusive. The fragmented and atheoretical state of the field thus has direct consequences for scholars’ ability to make cross-period connections.[^5] Laurent Pernot also stresses generic categories in a recent article calling for further work on religious rhetoric. Pernot divides sacred rhetoric according to historical genres, including worship (narrative, eulogy, preaching and naming the gods), discourse to the gods (prayers, hymns, and addresses), private meditation, and prophecy. He then conducts a thoughtful, historicized exploration of select genres in antiquity. Certainly, sacred rhetoric does have a few genres to call its own.[^6] Pernot’s attempt at briefly characterizing these genres offers some progress toward a theory of the distinctively rhetorical moves of sacred rhetoric, as in his claim that “prayer can be analyzed as a specific form of discourse,” that is, as a rhetorical genre with its own *topoi* and traits (242). Ultimately, however, Pernot’s discussion remains largely historical, with analysis of generic categories consigned to a brief introductory section. Rather than drawing out the generic categories of sacred rhetoric at length, Pernot merely defends the historical study of ancient sacred rhetoric. Pernot’s essay thus leaves the study of sacred rhetoric nearly as historically and generically fragmented as ever. The fragmented and atheoretical state of the field thus has direct consequences for scholars’ ability to make cross-period connections.

Other scholars have attempted more schematic treatments of sacred rhetoric, complementing the generic approach taken by Zulick and Pernot.[^7] Kristy Maddux describes the relationship between rhetoric and religion as having four valences: “(1) rhetoric is a tool used by religious groups; (2) political rhetoric draws upon religious language; (3) religious systems contribute to the discursive constructions of their adherents’ worldviews; and (4) religious traditions contribute to rhetorical theory and practice” (4333). Maddux’s ordering of these four directions for study is curious, for whereas (1) and (3) concern themselves with understanding sacred rhetoric in itself—as a tool religious groups use to persuade externally and internally—for (2) and (4) sacred rhetoric merely informs another branch of study, whether rhetoric in general or political rhetoric specifically. Accordingly, doing work via (2) and (4) might require no particular critical theory of sacred rhetoric—or, in the case of (2), might require a theory specific to the relationship between religion and politics. However, Maddux’s first and third valences offer the opportunity to understand sacred rhetoric on its own terms, as it is used by and shapes the “discursive constructions” of the worldviews of religious believers as well as those nonbelievers the group might hope to reach. Unfortunately, her emphasis here is disproportionately upon the discursive features of religion, its language and effect upon “worldviews.” To position sacred rhetoric as one among many “worldviews” is to concede the terms of the discussion to the IJsseling story, which centers around language.

Though religious groups are formed by language ideas, they are also shaped by the non-discursive: liturgical actions (kneeling to pray), architecture, social practices, music, and ways of acting in the world. James K.A. Smith argues that “worldview” as a concept fails to account for the ways in which people are not just thinking perceivers—world-viewers—but are desiring, embodied beings (Smith 32). We don’t just view the world with our minds: we feel it in our spines and desire it in our guts. An account of sacred rhetoric that can meaningfully contribute to the rhetorical tradition *contra* the IJsseling story must take account of religion’s embodied qualities. Though Maddux’s taxonomy has its uses, it requires amendment on this point.

In a similar vein, Grant Boswell’s “seven ways of looking at rhetoric and religion” may offer the most useful map available for the field (27). Boswell’s seven approaches to the area are as follows:

1.  “rhetorical theory by persons with religious purposes” (27).

2.  “rhetorical analysis of avowedly religious rhetorical practices” (27).

3.  “rhetorical analysis of practices by persons who are avowedly religious to determine how their religious orientation affects their seemingly secular speeches or writings” (27).

4.  “the rhetorical analysis of religious texts” (27).

5.  the recovery of lost or marginalized rhetors and rhetorics “from religious material through rhetorical analysis” (28).

6.  “the impact of a particular religious orientation on rhetoric in its broadest sense” (28).

7.  “the relation of rhetoric and religion in an era of discontinuity, past or present” (28).

Boswell’s list is distinct from that of Maddux not just in its detail, but in its greater emphasis upon understanding religion in itself. Though the nature of the “rhetorical analysis” conducted in any of these areas remains unstated to allow for a breadth of possibility, Boswell shows strong interest in the distinctive contributions of religion to the tradition, especially in advocating for the recovery of lost rhetorics (5) or rhetorical analysis that considers religion as an influence on secular rhetoric (3). Undoubtedly, most if not all of Boswell’s approaches could be used to reduce religion if a scholar took an approach that so reduced it, such as by treating religion as a resource that can only be used with appropriate secularization. However, Boswell’s language suggests a more positive relation, treating religion as its own way of making knowledge that can contribute to a critical theory of rhetoric, broadly understood. Boswell’s framing, which sees religion as having an “impact” on other modes of knowledge rather than being an exploited “contributor” or “resource” for secular thought, leaves open the possibility that religion could contribute to rhetoric without being reduced to something else.

Ultimately perhaps the most promising area to pursue a new conceptual framework for sacred rhetoric lies in Maddux’s (3) or Boswell’s (6): the valences or approaches that consider the rhetorical construction of religious communities and worldviews. This approach offers perhaps the widest lens through which to view sacred rhetoric. The rhetorical construction of religious communities can aptly integrate much of the substance contained in Maddux’s and Boswell’s other approaches, whether that includes studying how religious groups employ rhetoric (Maddux (1)), analyzing their theories of rhetoric (Boswell (1)), or expositing the rhetorical effects of religious practices and texts (Boswell (2) and (4)). Rather than taking the generic approach of Zulick and Pernot, then, my project starts by considering rhetorical influences upon religious communities. Where Maddux in particular limits rhetorical influences to language, however, I broaden the field still further, emphasizing a variety of rhetorical tools (images, bodily movements) as well as an expansive notion of community (including not just human actors but the environment they act within). I would therefore amend Maddux’s description of religious rhetoric as follows: sacred rhetoric considers “how religions construct religious groups as desiring, embodied beings through discursive and non-discursive rhetorical affordances.” My inquiry here is focused on providing a critical vocabulary and a conceptual framework for understanding this expanded notion of the field as well as, ultimately, an alternative history supported by that vocabulary. We cannot redress the fragmented nature of the field by narrowing our vision to certain genres and influences, even one so broad as language itself. We need an expansive idea of sacred rhetoric in order to attain a new, shared discourse on critical theoretical issues. My work aims to begin that conversation.

### Definitions: Rhetoric, of, Religion

Thus far I have argued that the atheoretical state of affairs in scholarship on sacred rhetoric has come about due to an account of the rhetorical tradition that sidelines the contributions of religion itself. On Shuger’s account, the secular cast of scholarship in sacred rhetoric has caused rhetoricians to overlook vital sources for developing a workable theory of the field. If this historical myopia has been the primary driving force behind the field’s fragmentation, though, scholarship has also suffered from a lack of terminological clarity—as in Zulick’s observation that the category of prophecy has not been sufficiently defined as to allow for cross-period connections. New theories of sacred rhetoric, then, must establish clear definitions of essential terms. Since my study aims to consider the field as a whole rather than select areas like prophecy, the essential terms derive directly from Burke’s foundational study, as follows: *rhetoric*, *of*, and *religion.* Accounting for my understanding of these terms will also clarify why I demur from Burke’s formulation and instead follow Shuger in terming the subject of my study “sacred rhetoric” instead.

#### Religion

The last of the three terms I will consider is the most complex, and yet also the most informative. If the rhetoric of religion has been atheoretical, a lack of definition for the word “religion” has been no small part of the problem—the surveys of the field that I examined do not dedicate serious attention to defining the term. Perhaps the most significant definitional work in the field comes in Burke’s *The Rhetoric of Religion* (hereafter *RR*)*.* Burke does not define “religion,” though he does open with a basic definition of theology as “words about God”—fairly uncontroversial and unimportant for my purposes (1). However, we can derive Burke’s definition of religion at least in part from his understanding of logology, his secular rhetorical undertaking modeled on religion. For Burke, logology studies human motives by beginning “with complex theories of transcendence . . . rather than the terminologies of simplified laboratory experiment” (5). If the rhetoric of religion studies logology, per Burke’s title, and logology involves “complex theories of transcendence,” then it follows that religion has to do with such theories. It would thus seem that Burke’s opening definition of theology was appropriate to the work, for certainly theology has to do with complex theorization. As a definition for religion, however, which involves the faithful not just in complex theories but in aesthetics, bodily practices, ethical behaviors, and devotional practices, it looks rather limited.

If definitions of “religion” are lacking in rhetorical studies, we must nonetheless seek a definition for the term elsewhere. In the field of religious studies, perhaps no question is more theoretically central nor contentious than how to define “religion.” A brief tour of the debate in that field will help to establish a more fruitful definition for rhetorical inquiry. Russell T. McCutcheon’s *Critics Not Caretakers* provides such a tour. Religious studies, as McCutcheon describes it, is divided into two camps: according to many in the field, including founding scholars for the discipline like Mircea Eliade, “the sacred” is a universal human experience, an essentially personal phenomenon which finds its expression in all the religions of the world.[^8] Religious studies, for this camp, investigates this experience, which is taken as a metaphysical reality, across a variety of religious traditions. The other camp, however, sees the study of religion not as interpreting experiences of the sacred or the numinous, but as “the study of an ordinary aspect of social, historical experience” (McCutcheon xii). For these scholars (McCutcheon is one), who take a social-scientific rather than a theological point of view, religion “can be conceptualized and then explained as thoroughly human activity, with no mysterious distillate left over” (xi). In short, this approach takes no position on the metaphysical reality of religious beliefs, insisting on a methodological reduction to what is observable by scholars.

Moreover, McCutcheon pushes back vigorously and persuasively against those of his critics who charge him with reductionism, stressing that all theorizing and scholarly redescription is, to one degree or another, reductive (12). The word “religion” must thus be understood as a useful tool for scholarly analysis rather than a metaphysical essence, and its meaning will vary depending on the interests of the theorists. McCutcheon’s critique of the notion of religion as a wholly private, ineffable, mystical experience is therefore not that such an idea is culturally bounded, since all ideas are culturally bounded, but that it is an insufficient tool for the work at hand, one that obfuscates with a focus on a “mystical distillate” which scholars cannot observe. In contrast, social, economic, and material analysis—the standard tools of social-scientific and humanistic analysis—all have the virtues of focusing attention on those factors which scholars can observe, discuss, and critique.

In addition to insisting on methodological clarity, McCutcheon terms the concept of religion itself a “folk category” drawn from scholars’ own cultural background in Western modernity, rather than a universal human experience. The term “religion” derives from “a rather limited number of linguistic/cultural families”—those of the Latin West—and applying it to groups from other cultures is reductionist at best (10). For people outside the Latin language family that the word “religion” derives from, it may not be a useful category. Furthermore, even in societies that do use the category of religion, McCutcheon argues that “its popular usage is intimately linked to a people’s own self-descriptions,” including self-described categories like “good Catholic” or “I’m saved” (11). He thus argues that “religion” is of limited use as a category for those scholars who want to report on the observable behavior of human beings rather than reproducing the notion of “religion” as such.

Although McCutcheon’s critique of privatized and universalizing notions of religion is well taken, rejecting such a paradigm need not mean reducing religion to the social, nor does an investigation of the sacred mean rejecting study of religion as a “thoroughly human activity.” Insofar as McCutcheon insists that the social is all that remains after any “mystical distillate” is stripped away, he shows himself to have a limited and positivistic notion of human knowledge. If “religion” is a folk category of Latin origin—a claim I do not dispute—then we should note that “the social,” however better defined it may be, is also a Latin construction (partly borrowed from Latin *socialis*; see “social, *adj.* and *n*,” *Oxford English Dictionary)* that is, if not more, certainly not less culturally specific than “religion.” Scholars focused on materiality like Bruno Latour and Jane Bennett have shown us that even the social is not just the social, but that human relationships are impinged upon by other actors from the strange-to-us world of the nonhuman.[^9] Though this idea of influences beyond the human world may seem unsettling and even superstitious to those of us who dwell in Western modernity, such impulses reflect our own culture and folk categories rather than rigorous scholarly reflection. Experiences of the sacred seem to be endemic to human societies, from the visions of Julian of Norwich to rituals meant to ward off demons in tribal societies. It would be hard to find anything more human. The question becomes, then, how to investigate these phenomena without becoming a theologian (not a bad route, but one not every scholar will choose) or reverting to the insufficiently vague folk categories of religion and the social. How, in other words, can we give religion its due as a real category of human knowledge?

The difficulty of talking about the sacred can be ameliorated, I will argue, through the work of speculative realist thinkers: scholars whose work depends upon philosophical-rhetorical explorations of phenomena that the scholar cannot directly observe. If McCutcheon argues that the scholar (as social scientist) cannot speak of God, religious experience, or the ineffable, I would answer, with Graham Harman: “The choice is not just between speaking of something or not speaking of it. We all know a way of speaking of a thing without quite speaking of it: namely, we *allude* to it” (68). Speculative realism is an allusive way of thinking, one which grants all beings—even fictional or unobservable ones—the dignity of being treated as full participants in reality. The supernatural may be a fiction, but it is (at least) a real fiction. It exercises an undeniable influence on the construction of buildings, the organization of political parties, and the actions of countless human beings, and therefore, for speculative realism, God and the gods are ontologically equal to other objects that we can observe more directly. The effects of something called “the social” are no less intangible and no less real.

Charles Taylor speaks to essentially this same point in a discussion of Edward Gibbon that might be read as a rejoinder to McCutcheon:

> Gibbon treats ecclesiastical history as though we could disregard altogether whether the religious doctrines in contest are true or false. He declares none of them false, but he writes as though any truth they might contain can be disregarded for the purposes of explaining what happened. But this is not just the termination of an (unjustified) exceptional status, which brings all institutions under what are identified as “the same social laws.” No one writes history like that, i.e., in a way which factors out the truth of any and all beliefs that people have about their condition, in which the agents are struggling with their fate, either advancing, or retarding or moving forward and back, but in virtue of our understanding of their condition, not all movement are seen as explanatorily on the same footing . . . .
>
> No meaningful narrative can treat all the beliefs of the agents described as equally explanatorily irrelevant. Gibbon’s move was to write as though he were indeed, bracketing questions of the truth or falsehood of religious beliefs for explanatory purposes; but this couldn’t be described as treating the institutions carrying those beliefs on the same footing as others, e.g., the institutions and practices of polite civilization, whose rise is partly explained by their validity. In fact, religious beliefs themselves are not really bracketed in this account; the understanding in many cases is that they are false, once the heavy irony is peeled off. (272-73)

As Taylor makes uncomfortably clear, to argue that one must understand religion as a social force with no “mystical distillate” involved is in fact to treat religion as we treat *no other* social phenomenon—that is, as a form devoid of content, where the beliefs of the actual participants are irrelevant. To insist, for instance, that the only way to study the rise of democratic political ideas is as if what matters are the social relationships between party members and not the actual political ideas at stake would be nonsensical: certainly a social analysis of such movements is a valid approach, but study of the content of such movements is also necessary. A speculative approach to religion thus need not posit the metaphysical reality of a God or gods, nor must it insist on some universal, private religious experience. Instead, freed of a need to pursue universals or to bracket particular experiences, a speculative account of religion would seek to help us imagine purely unique experiences and allude to ineffable phenomena.

Establishing such an approach will require a modified understanding of the task of critical theory. The folk category of religion has left rhetorical studies in a state of atheoretical disarray; yet McCutcheon’s social constructionist approach merely doubles down on the spirit of critique which has left us, as Shuger argues, with religion as a lacuna for the field. Following the speculative realists, we must “bring the sword of criticism to criticism itself,” to quote Bruno Latour (“Why Has Critique,” 227). For Latour, the spirit of critical suspicion is a necessary element of intellectual life, but its popularization in science studies has enabled conspiracy theorists, climate change deniers, and other suspect actors. In religion, the proliferation of spiteful village atheists like Richard Dawkins might be the equivalent development.

Latour’s response to this proliferation of critique is not to give up and become a naive realist (if that were even possible), but to propose a move from debunking to whole-hearted construction, to become “someone who *adds* reality to matters of fact” (“Why Has Critique,” 232). This implies that when dealing with a phenomenon like science or religion, we must not stand back to critique, but must rather stand closer, in order to follow its operations more carefully. Latour does not repudiate the insights of critique—he is not saying that those who point out religion’s socially constructed aspects are wrong—but rather enjoins us to take those insights as *adding* reality to the phenomena we study rather than diminishing them. Science may be (indeed, is) created by scientists, but that does not diminish the validity of scientific insights—even if they receive their value from a slightly different place. Religion is indeed socially constructed, but it is no less real for that.

A speculative approach to religion thus would define it thus: religion (or the sacred) is that which cannot be reduced to either the social or the ineffable. It encompasses human behaviors that gather together the observable human behaviors of the social with the transhuman forces of the supernatural. No matter how we view the metaphysical status of either element, through speculation we can posit the real influence of the supernatural on human institutions, in the form not just of ideas and beliefs, but bodily habits and ways of life. Following Shuger, Taylor, and Latour, the study of religion must thus add matters of the supernatural back to McCutcheon’s critical social constructionism.

#### Rhetoric

This speculative approach to the question of religion also informs my understanding of the first term in my triad, rhetoric. Contemporary approaches drawing on speculative realist thinkers define rhetoric almost as broadly as possible, as a field which studies not just speeches or theories, but a full scope of techniques that may be used to persuade, from language to bodies to technologies to activities and rituals. I take it as axiomatic that persuasion occurs not just between the ears nor simply through human language and thought, but in concert with numerous other actors and forces. The purpose of rhetorical scholarship, then, is to seek out and understand rhetorical affordances (possibilities and potencies) wherever they occur, whether in a sermon, a marquee, or a bank of candles.

Such a definition of rhetoric includes the traditional sites and canons of the field: forensic, judicial, and epideictic genres; invention, arrangement, style, memory, and delivery; Aristotle, Cicero, and Quintilian; writing and oratory. However, it is not exhausted by these classical categories and influences, but also takes into account the persuasive import of architecture, ritual, daily habits, and the arts. Only such an expansive notion of rhetoric can account for the sites in which sacred rhetoric appears, both those already comfortably within the tradition (Augustine, George Campbell) and those whose work is no less rhetorical and persuasive for falling outside it (hymnodists, catechists, and preachers). Sacred rhetoric includes any persuasion, however linguistic or non-linguistic, done to sacred purposes.

#### Of

Finally, having investigated my two key terms, it remains to consider how they are commonly joined in the field, for the phrase “rhetoric of religion” seems to have taken on its own semantic force in rhetorical studies. The phrase stems from Burke’s book of that title, yet it is unclear whether the meanings Burke assigns to the term are at all those later scholars mean. As Boswell notes, the phrase “rhetoric of religion” can have deeply disparate meanings.

The speculative understanding of rhetoric and religion I have outlined here makes it difficult to countenance the idea that rhetoric and religion are separate domains, and that scholarship can or should proceed by importing rhetorical concepts from without into the domain of religion. From a speculative realist position, such a notion weakens rhetoric by reducing it to a narrow tradition of thought derived from classical or critical theory, and it weakens religion by positioning it as a domain that cannot understand itself without the outside imposition of rhetorical theory. A rhetoric *of* religion in this sense, then, is precisely not what I seek to develop.

Although I will continue to use the phrase “rhetoric of religion” to denote how the field has constructed itself in the wake of Burke, “sacred rhetoric” (following Shuger’s phrasing) better articulates my own approach. This phrase can bear much the same breadth of meaning as the traditional formulation, but without importing problematically narrow ideas of rhetoric and religion. As a more neutral term, it simply designates places where religious concerns are articulated in ways amenable to rhetorical understanding, or that construct a distinctively sacred theory of rhetoric, whether one that takes place in sacred spaces or draws upon an idea of the divine.

### Rhetorical Histories and the Crossed-out God

Having articulated the atheoretical state of the field and defined my key terms, it only remains for this introductory treatment to provide a rationale for the historical methodology of this dissertation. Our histories of rhetoric frame the ways in which we analyze individual rhetorics and rhetoricians, and so it would behoove us to ensure that these stories possess a sufficiently robust account of sacred rhetoric. Given the theoretical problems I have identified so far, it is hardly surprising that these stories do not yet feature such an account. In the following section I will identify three key sites where a neglect or misunderstanding of sacred rhetoric is evident in conventional accounts of the history of rhetoric. Having located these sites of neglect, I will argue that we need to redress these failings of the conventional history in order to develop a sufficiently critical and theory of rhetoric at large.

Drawing on Shuger’s analysis of how the conventional story of the discipline neglects sacred rhetoric, we can identify two key places where this neglect misshapes our approach to the field. The first appears when fundamentally religious people in rhetorical history are divorced from their context and understood as purely rhetorical figures; or worse, their religious views are taken to be a distraction from their rhetorical value. It would be unnecessary and somewhat perverse to catalog all such instances, and so an example will have to suffice for now. Perhaps the most prominent examples of religious thinkers whose place in the history of rhetoric has been fully secularized are the famous trio of Hugh Blair, George Campbell, and Richard Whately. All three were clergymen, and their works are intimately concerned with religious subjects (see my discussion of Campbell in Chapter 5), yet that element of their thought does not seem to contribute to their place in rhetorical history as Enlightenment rhetoricians *par excellance.* Indeed, Patricia Bizzell and Bruce Herzberg, in their standard history of rhetoric, seem to view Whately’s religion as fundamentally a distraction from his rhetorical thought, arguing that “Whately is by no means purely parochial. His contribution to rhetoric is not limited to ecclesiastical uses” (985). It does not seem to occur to them that Whately’s religion might be not a distraction, but an important part of how his rhetorical theory came to be. Whately’s status as an archbishop in the Church of Ireland need not necessarily shape his rhetorical theory, yet dismissing that side of his career and commitments as “parochial” does not help us better understand his rhetorical thought. To the contrary, I will show through the course of this dissertation that sacred influences on rhetorical thought are far from mere sectarian leanings, but that they often ground a distinctly new contribution to rhetoric.

The second site of tension with sacred rhetoric in the field comes in the way in which an insufficient account of religion leads to an insufficient account of the Middle Ages. Bizzell and Herzberg, for example, view the Church fathers as so hostile to pagan rhetoric that they cut this tradition off almost entirely, a view which justifies the limited space allotted to the period in their anthology.[^10] Bizzell and Herzberg do concede that Augustine was influenced by classical rhetoric, but claim that “Augustine’s accommodation of rhetoric and Christianity did not result in much new work on rhetoric in the Middle Ages” (8). This astonishing claim is called into question by the very readings Bizzell and Herzberg excerpt, yet they hold to the view that the vast body of medieval rhetoric is mostly purely practical, with little new theoretical or preceptive value.

This diminishment of the Middle Ages is the rule, not the exception, in histories of rhetoric. The force of the narrative is so powerful that even scholars focused on the Middle Ages endorse it: for example, Joseph M. Miller, Michael H. Prosser, and Thomas W. Benson seem to endorse a dismissive reading of medieval rhetoric in an anthology *of medieval rhetoric,* which their preface refers to as “no longer a living growth” which “exhibits symptoms of degeneration, atrophy, distortion” (xi). Thomas Conley, Rita Copeland and Ineke Sluiter, and James J. Murphy all offer fuller treatments, but even so none presents a full account of the theoretical contributions of sacred rhetoric in the period.[^11]

The conventional dismissal of the Middle Ages is not only unjust to that period of history—though it is that—but it supports a deeply flawed mode of thought, one tied to certain biases of modernity, best analyzed in Latour’s *We Have Never Been Modern.* This early statement of Latour’s philosophy interrogates the assumptions of modern and postmodern thought in a manner that is highly productive for understanding the conventional history of rhetoric. For Latour, “modernity” signifies a rigorous theoretical division between culture and nature, which is also tracked onto an asymmetry between the transcendent (what Latour calls the “crossed-out God”) and the immanent. Humans (culture), nonhumans (nature), and the crossed-out God (the transcendent) are constantly ascribed to separate ontological categories.

Yet modernity also uses the categories human, nonhuman and the transcendent to create what Latour calls “imbroglios,” phenomena which mix together the three entities which should be separate, all the while denying that these imbroglios mix anything. Latour’s most powerful examples of imbroglios are the AIDS virus and the aerosol can:

> The smallest AIDS virus takes you from sex to the unconscious, then to Africa, tissue cultures, DNA and San Francisco, but the analysts . . . will slice the delicate network traced by the virus for you into tidy compartments where you will find only science, only economy, only social phenomena, only local news, only sentiment, only sex. Press the most innocent aerosol button and you’ll be headed for the Antarctic, and from there to the University of California at Irvine, the mountain ranges of Lyon, the chemistry of inert gases, and then maybe to the United Nations, but this fragile thread will be broken into as many segments are there are pure disciplines. (2-3)

No matter how much a phenomenon brings together politics, science, and cultural studies—as Latour says the AIDS virus and the aerosol clearly do—modernity pulls them apart again. In order to proliferate these hybrids through the powers of science and all the modern regime of power and knowledge, modernity must deny their existence, insisting that, for instance, the existence of catastrophic climate change is “purely” a scientific matter, with no smack of politics or theology.

These asymmetries are enforced all the more in our division between the transcendent and the immanent, the realm of the crossed-out God. For Latour, “No one is truly modern who does not agree to keep God from interfering with Natural Law as well as with the laws of the Republic” (33). The specter of the divine discomfits modernity because it calls into question a strict division between facts (the realm of science) and values (the realm of politics). God must therefore be crossed out—not killed, a la Nietzsche, but merely made “wholly individual and wholly spiritual,” and thus kept separate in the asymmetric mode of modern thought (33).

It is easy to see how this strict division between the transcendent and immanent has had its influence on the rhetorical tradition: the medieval period becomes the realm of transcendence, a period of primarily religious approaches to rhetorical theory. Within the framework set up by modernity,[^12] the Middle Ages looks like it has nothing new to say in terms of “secular” rhetoric. Medieval thinkers are understood as largely just appropriating Cicero and applying his theory to religious contexts. Augustine and Gregory are understood as theologians with no rhetorical ideas of their own, dependent on Cicero for the forms of their discourse, even if their content is wholly original.[^13] In order to escape this limited, modern mode of thought, we need a notion of religion as a tradition of rhetorical thought in its own right, as offering something to rhetorical theory beyond subject matter that has no influence on rhetorical form.

We must follow Stephen Toulmin, who attacks the modern division between nature and culture by taking on the tendency of modern science (stemming from 17th-century philosophy) to insist that only decontextualized facts are valid: “one aim of 17th-century philosophers was to frame all their questions in terms that rendered them *independent of context*” (21). Following this scientistic regime, modern rhetoric must render rhetorical theory as a context-free (and thus religion-free) body of purely rational thought. In contrast, Toulmin advocates a procedure that “will be the opposite—to *recontextualize* the questions these philosophers took most pride in decontextualizing” (21). One way of accomplishing such a task is to recognize that religion has its own contribution to rhetoric—to think about religious rhetoric *religiously,* to employ a phrasing derived from Latour.[^14]

### Counter-history

In order to think about sacred rhetoric religiously, we need not just a new theoretical framework—though we do need that—but a new account of rhetoric’s history, one which accounts for religion, that does not cross out God. Taylor articulates well the value of historical retellings in his account of why he feels a need to re-tell the story of secularism:

> Our sense of where we are is crucially defined in part by a story of how we got there. In that sense, there is an inescapable (though often negative) God-reference in the very nature of our secular age. And just because we describe where we are in relating the journey, we can misdescribe it grievously by misidentifying the itinerary. . . . To get straight where we are, we have to go back and tell the story properly. (29)

The situation is similar in the study of sacred rhetoric. We need what I will call, following Byron Hawk, a counter-history of religious rhetoric. That is, we need a story that recognizes that historiography is not a disinterested, scientific discipline, but rather an act of storytelling performed by fundamentally *interested* persons. Just as Hawk re-narrates the history of rhetoric to revive the maligned tradition of vitalism,[^15] on my analysis it will be necessary to retell the story of rhetoric in order to rediscover the neglected religious rhetorics already present within our conventional stories. Throughout, my approach will be informed by the speculative sacred rhetoric I outlined in this introduction, as well as by the philosophical-rhetorical-historical work of Latour and Taylor.

This focus on rhetorical history necessarily limits my inquiry in some significant ways. As my focus will be on re-telling the standard history of rhetoric, with a particular focus on the maligned Middle Ages, “sacred rhetoric” for me will largely mean Western, Christian rhetoric. This is simply a limitation of scope made in order to respond to stories of the rhetorical tradition most directly, since both the key theorist of the rhetoric of religion (Burke) and the key historian of philosophy and rhetoric (IJsseling) largely direct their attentions this way. There is undoubtedly further work to be done in other traditions, and I hope that scholars will take my reconsideration of rhetorical history as provocation to explore the rhetorical depth of other sacred traditions as well.[^16]

Before embarking on my counter-history in chapter 5, however, it will be necessary to define, further than this introduction could do, a theoretical approach to religious rhetoric, through conversation with key thinkers for the past and future of the field. Through interaction with Burke, Latour, and Taylor, I will develop an approach to sacred rhetoric that will support my pursuit of a new history of rhetoric. If sacred rhetoric represents an undiscovered country, by these reflections on theory, history, and practice I hope to provide if not a full-fledged cartography, at least a useful map of one section of the territory.

## Chapter Two: Kenneth Burke: Cross-pressured Theologian

> Burke did not “get over” bodies, but it was not for lack of trying. Try as he might, he could never shake the point that language always involves the body.
> 
> - Debra Hawhee, *Moving Bodies: Kenneth Burke at the Edges of Language,* 106.

In my introduction, I argued that scholarship on the rhetoric of religion must take two things more seriously: first, religion as its own form of human culture, rather than something to be explained (away) through other, secular disciplines; and second, religion as a phenomenon encompassing more than the linguistic and ideological, something constituted by social and material factors as well. My review of scholarship on the subject suggests that the field has, to the contrary, been a secularizing and purely linguistic domain to this point.

Because Kenneth Burke’s influence unquestionably looms over the rhetoric of religion, we need to ask what responsibility his work holds for this state of affairs. Although it might seem that the state of the field must necessarily be laid directly at Burke’s feet—after all, he certainly overshadows, and arguably created, this area of inquiry in our discipline—by no means is it clear that Burke himself can be held to account for the status quo. Indeed, examining critical engagement with Burke’s writing on religion shows the field to lack clarity on whether Burke should be understood as a critical, secularizing figure or something more unusual, perhaps more devout. Burke’s critical spirit and his religious impulses intertwine and conflict with one another, producing a body of thought with complex and contradictory impulses. Whereas scholarship tends to reduce Burke to either a critic or a deliberately elusive believer, I will argue for a more holistic view, drawing on Charles Taylor’s understanding of religion in modernity. Taylor’s account of the challenges and complexities of modern religion show Burke to be neither a pure skeptic nor an uncomplicated believer, but a figure whose religious impulses were deeply shaped and thoroughly problematized by the experience of modern life. Attaining this new understanding of Burke will help us better grapple with how his agenda has shaped the study of sacred rhetoric.

In order to grasp this conflicted nature of Burke’s thought and position the field for a more constructive engagement with religion, we need to move beyond the field’s typical focus on the *Rhetoric of Religion* (hereafter *RR*). When Burke is read in light of Taylor’s account of modernity, it becomes clear that the *RR* has significant limitations as the foundation of what I have called a speculative sacred rhetoric. *RR* is a quintessentially modern work according to Taylor’s understanding of that term, and as such offers an understanding of religion limited by modern biases. Scholarship on Burke’s understanding of religion demonstrates this with its oscillation between understanding Burke as a pure critic and as a secretive believer. The rhetoric of religion that Burke is reputed to have founded thus becomes equally confused. After demonstrating these tensions in the critical understanding of Burke, I will argue through close engagement with Burke’s key texts on religion that we should look to *Permanence and Change* (hereafter *PC*) rather than *RR* as a foundation for understanding Burke’s thought on religion and the study of sacred rhetoric in general. Ultimately, I argue that the notion of orientation in *PC* provides a framework for understanding religious phenomena with more robust detail than the logology of *RR*.

Scholarship on the history of rhetoric and religion has commonly begun the story with Burke, but in general the only work treated is the *RR.* Moreover, that work is presented in the critical, linguistic terms favored by our discourse at large. Kristy Maddux’s summary is representative: “Kenneth Burke (1961) notes that because words for the natural world are commonly used to explain the supernatural and because the reverse is also true, the ways that we see our natural world are always influenced by our theologies” (4334). Though Maddux here accomplishes the challenging task of summarizing one of KB’s books in a single sentence, her interpretation of the work as concerned ultimately with “words for the natural world” reproduces the limitations of the field. Maddux describes Burke as contributing to the rhetoric of religion, but in fact her summary describes his work as being not about religion, but about how religion contributes to an understanding of the “natural world.” In thus reducing sacred rhetoric to the natural, Maddux epitomizes a common understanding of the field, as we shall see. Similarly, Michael Souders lists *RR* alone of Burke’s work among his bibliography for sources on religious rhetoric, summarized as follows: “all types of rhetoric and language—secular and religious—are tied to the formal organization, hierarchy, and transcendence of religious rituals” (n.p.). Souders here reads Burke as linking language and transcendence in an essential bond, in keeping with Burke’s principle from *RR* that rhetoricians should always begin by understanding “complex theories of transcendence” (*RR* 5). Although Souders’s mention of ritual introduces an element of something beyond language here, his emphasis on essentially discursive, structural forces—“organization, hierarchy, and transcendence”—limits his discussion much like that of Maddux.

Moving beyond general treatments of the field to Burkean scholarship, a critical, secular understanding of Burke similarly holds as the dominant paradigm. Though attention to the Burkean corpus beyond *RR* can help scholars see greater complexity to the secular Burke than appears in general works on religious rhetoric, this body of scholarship nonetheless remains critically and linguistically focused. Whether this is attributable to an outsized influence for the *RR* or merely reflective of the field’s lack of a more nuanced understanding of religion itself—and establishing causality is not essential here—there can be no question that Burke, as understood by Burkeans, espouses a critical, linguistic understanding of religious rhetoric, rather than a more speculative and material sacred rhetoric.

Perhaps the key figure here is William H. Rueckert, one of the most influential early figures in Burke studies. In a move that has clearly shaped the direction of the field, Rueckert reads Burke as an explicitly and essentially secularizing thinker. For Rueckert, Burke’s entire body of work represents an attempt to “systematize a naturalistic, linguistically-oriented, secular variant of Christianity” (133). According to Rueckert, not just *RR* but Burke’s entire corpus represents a translation of Christian ideas of God, Heaven, Hell, redemption, and so on into a secular idiom as a way of understanding how language works. Dramatism (Burke’s earlier system for understanding human action based on the elements of drama) and logology (his later, more linguistic system from *RR*) alike, on this understanding, are essentially Christianity, but freed of supernaturalism and grounded in empiricism and science: Rueckert calls Burke’s system “a new ‘scientific’ religion which twentieth-century man can ‘believe’ in, but which, unlike the old one it replaces, is designed to save man in this world” (133-34). Rueckert’s articulation of Burke here is deeply modern, drawing on common assumptions that undergird post-Enlightenment critical thought. It flows from the conviction that supernaturalism is inherently unbelievable for modern people, and that Christianity must therefore be stripped of such notions in order to be useful in the modern world. Such ideas, though widespread in modernity, are critical by definition, having arisen with the demythologizing biblical criticism of figures like David Friedrich Strauss, Ludwig Feuerbach, and Rudolf Bultmann (see Harrisville and Sundberg 8, 85). Though Rueckert does not make this connection, his account of Burke places him squarely within this tradition of secularized, modern Christianity—the religion of Latour’s crossed-out God, as discussed in my introduction.[^17]

Moreover, for Rueckert, Burke’s system is deeply linguistic. He distinguishes between Christianity and dramatism primarily on the basis of the power acceded to language, arguing that whereas Christianity might make God the definitive scene of human action, “Burke says that language is *the* scene and operates as a motive in all experiences possible to man” (134). Whereas Christianity centers on a person—even the Word (*λόγος*) of John’s Gospel is a person (see John 1:14)—Burke’s secular Christianity centers on language, insisting that it is the motivational force that shapes all human experiences, even non-verbal ones. On Rueckert’s interpretation, then, the key move Burke makes to secularize Christianity is to replace God with language.[^18] This linguistic focus even extends to a critical account of religion’s origins: Rueckert claims that “the empirical constraints that Burke always seems to put on himself favor the view that Christian theology is a function—that is, a creation—of language” (245). Such a reading makes Burke not merely a demythologizing critic of religion, but a skeptic of the highest order, providing a humanistic account of religion’s origin that reduces it to a function of language, much as scholars like Russell McCutcheon, referenced in my introduction, reduce the phenomenon to the social. Any such approach to religious phenomena, that reduces them to the creation of a single aspect of human culture, can never support a speculative sacred rhetoric, for it will inevitably revert to explanations of religious rhetorics in terms of the single, master motivation, be it language or the social. Though Rueckert’s scholarship draws on an expansive reading of Burke, then, its critical, linguistic interpretation offers no more of a future for religious rhetoric than scholarship which is restricted more narrowly to *RR.*

Following in Rueckert’s footsteps to provide a sophisticated account of Burke’s importance, Timothy W. Crusius also furthers understanding of Burke as a critical, linguistic thinker above all. Crusius seeks to articulate Burke’s value as a philosopher by showing him to have anticipated many of the key debates of postmodern critical theory. Accordingly, Crusius describes Burke’s philosophy as “language-centered; he held that philosophy could not claim an objective position above or apart from culture or society but was itself caught up in both; and he acknowledged, and thought that philosophy should acknowledge, the will to power inseparable from claims to truth” (2). Crusius thus positions Burke as closely aligned with figures of high critical theory like Lyotard, Foucault, and Derrida—and thus as a proponent of a philosophy oriented primarily towards critique and linguistic analysis.[^19] When approaching the subject of religion, this critical orientation drives Crusius to describe Burke’s *RR* as diminishing non-linguistic forces. He quotes Burke’s dictum that logology must begin with “complex theories of transcendence” rather than lab experiments as proof that Burke opposes Derrida’s deconstruction of onto-theology—that is, unlike Derrida, Burke accepts that traditional theology has much to teach us and does not attempt to deconstruct or pass beyond it. However, Crusius then links Burke’s openness to onto-theology explicitly to language: “To have language, to exist in a world rather than only an environment, is to find ourselves always already ‘beyond’—‘transcendent’ of—nonlinguistic existence. Hence, to ignore, dismiss, or deconstruct onto-theology is, willy-nilly, to play into the hands of scientific reductionism” (122). Though Crusius intends this gloss on Burke as a defense of conventional, metaphysical theology, this defense is accomplished only at the expense of a dismissal of the nonlinguistic. Crusius positions theology with language and characterizes deconstruction as an attack on language as such. Language and metaphysics are positioned as transcending the material, and thought which emphasizes the latter risks falling into scientific reductionism. From a speculative point of view, however, to stress the material is not to attempt scientific reduction, but to insist that not only language, but matter exceeds our reductionist attempts to grasp it. As Graham Harman (cited in chapter one) argues, objects withdraw from one another and so “Object-oriented philosophy does not reduce, and hence offers no finger-wagging lectures to the humanities on behalf of science” (143). To stress the material need not mean attempting to effect a reduction of language, but may simply mean making language weirder by linking it to the strange and withdrawing particularities of objects. Theologians who investigate such traditional topics as the sacraments, which unite language and objects, the transcendent and the immanent, understand this well. As valuable as Crusius’s work is for understanding Burke’s philosophical import, then, his critical orientation limits the value of his work for a speculative account of Burke’s religion.[^20]

Other Burkeans, while not taking an understanding of Burke as critic to the same lengths as Rueckert and Crusius, largely reflect his understanding of Burke’s thought as secular and linguistic. William FitzGerald’s *Spiritual Modalities: Prayer as Rhetoric and Performance* offers a Burkean take on the rhetoric of prayer, taking up valuable topics like *kairos* (the opportune moment) in prayer and prayer as memory. FitzGerald’s understanding of Burke (and of his own subject), however, leads him to frame his project as “a *critical* and also *secular* rhetoric” of prayer (5). For FitzGerald, this largely means that he takes a social constructionist view of religion, in line with McCutcheon’s approach—defining religion as a social phenomenon above all. He argues that “prayer serves, above all, as a practical meta-rhetoric whose ultimate purpose is to sound out the limits and possibilities inherent in social cooperation imagined at its most thoroughgoing” (10). Although this is a compelling argument regarding the social purposes prayer can serve, by making prayer about the social “above all,” it neglects other forces that might be at work, such as (for example) the believer’s feeling of being closer to God. FitzGerald’s Burkean understanding of religion, then, adds a social element above Rueckert’s, but remains highly reductive. Bradford T. Stull’s reading of the religious Burke similarly moves in the right direction by emphasizing that Burke had a political and not just a theoretical agenda, noting that Burke hoped “to heal a world painfully divided” through a rhetoric aimed at peace (30). However, Stull’s understanding of Burke as working through “a language mysticism” ultimately skews his work too far toward the linguistic as well, defining Burke’s project as one centered purely around the linguistic (30). By concluding his treatment of Burke with a consideration of God as “pure persuasion,” Stull suggests that Burke’s religious thought is aimed at language above all else, furthering the field’s sense of Burke’s religious thought as essentially defined by a critical perspective and linguistic focus (58).

Other Burkeans secularize Burke even more radically by essentially ignoring the subject matter of *RR,* treating it as an extension of the Burkean system rather than as a work specifically on religion. For instance, Barbara A. Biesecker argues that *RR* is “on the same subject” as the *Rhetoric of Motives,* and treats it as Burke’s lost *Symbolic of Motives* in order to use Burke to build a theory of language-driven social change (Biesecker 54). Though Biesecker’s attempt to put Burke into conversation with contemporary philosophy, like Crusius’s, has significant philosophical value, she operates fully within the terms of postmodern critique, where language and the social exclude all other factors as sources of motivation and causality. Similarly, Robert Wess positions *RR* as the culmination of Burke’s scholarship, in some ways supplanting dramatism (217). For Wess, it does so by offering “a theory of the subject,” much as the *Symbolic of Motives* was meant to do (218). Like Biesecker, Wess essentially reads *RR* as a work of secular, critical theory offering perspectives on subjectivity, history, and epistemology—but little actual interpretation of religion.

Whereas most scholars have offered a secularizing reading of Burke and *RR,* select Burkeans have made a case for him as a religious thinker. Though this group has included a few prominent Burkeans (see Appel 104, Feehan 208), the religious perspective on Burke remains a minority position in the field. Some of this is no doubt due to Burke’s own demurral on the question of his religion, yet the most developed arguments for understanding Burke as a religious thinker take this into account. Edward C. Appel, in making his case for Burke as a “coy” or at least “generic” theologian, uses Burke’s own thought against him to argue that he is not free of the theological motive. No matter whether Burke believes in God or not, Appel argues, the structure of his thought “invariably forces its devotees to reach beyond this realm of universal defect,” thus following the motivational patterns of religion: “Whether people are waiting for God or waiting for Godot, they are still waiting. They are still theological beings. And Burke is not ultimately a demystifier in any case. Though it may be chipped or cracked, the ‘magic spell’ of language cannot be broken, he maintains” (105). Appel defines theology as thought that points beyond the immanent and establishes expectation, waiting, for the arrival of the divine. Since Burke participates in that structure, for Appel, Burke’s thought has at least the form of a theology, a system of thought that implies something beyond the immanent exists as the perfecting term of symbol systems. This implies that even the language of “secular theology” is inadequate, implying as it does a reduction to the immanent. Although Appel’s reading of Burke continues to be heavily linguistic, in resisting a reduction of Burke’s system to the immanent he provides an opening for what my introduction calls a “speculative rhetoric of religion”—that is, a mode of rhetorical inquiry that does not reduce all religious phenomena to immanent, observable forces (language, the social), remains open to the possibility of thinking about religion as something that inquires into that which is not observable. Appel’s Burke, with his search for a “perfected audience” beyond himself, seems open to such a rhetoric (105).

Similarly, Wayne C. Booth has described Burke as engaged in a “lifetime project” of “disguised theology” (“Many Voices,” 195). Booth borrows Rueckert’s notion that Burke presents the reader with many different voices or personas, and makes a strong case, in two interrelated articles, that some of these Burkes were religious. Much like Appel, Booth sees Burke’s ideas about hierarchy as implying some kind of actual entity at the top: “it must be real, from the beginning—real in the sense of existing, of being, of acting from top to bottom of the pyramid” (“Kenneth Burke’s Religious Rhetoric,” 36). Though Booth avoids linking Burke to any specific religious doctrines, he insists that religious inquiry forms a key part of his work. Booth draws on his personal letters from Burke to demonstrate how the latter resisted having his thought reduced to a focus on language, suggesting that religious concepts offered him more than a vocabulary:

Burke was distressed, more and more openly as the years went by, when any thinker reduced all reality to language. Consider, for example, his annoyance about deconstructionists like Derrida who, in Burke’s reading, deny the plain fact, the hard substantive reality, that a child learns to distinguish real tastes before he or she learns any words for distinguishing tastes. Any careful reader of the whole of what he called boiks-woiks will discover that in his gut, as in his heart, KB knew that he was grappling not just with language about reality but with the reality of value distinctions and their mysterious source at the top. His reality was permeated with the presence of a mysteriously shifting, unfixable totality so complex, so full of conflicts between what look to us like both affirmations and negations, that no human language can ever encompass Him/Her/It/Them. (“Kenneth Burke’s Religious Rhetoric,” 39)

Burke’s interest in motion and the body (well documented by Debra Hawhee) thus comes to serve as a token of how seriously he takes religion. For Booth, Burke’s multifaceted approach to the world was too complex to allow him to reduce any phenomenon to mere effects of language, and he must thus be understood as approaching religion in deadly earnest, if not with orthodox religious ideas or practices. Even when Burke appears to be only exploring language, then, as in the *RR,* Booth argues that his ostensible interest in the terminology of religious value distinctions only masks a real interest in “genuine religious belief” (“Many Voices,” 197).

Appel and Booth, then, take us a good way toward an understanding of Burke that could provide a better foundation for the rhetoric of religion—one open to a speculative, rather than a critical, rhetoric of religion. In particular, by shifting attention from Burke’s interest in language to a more holistic understanding of his work, Booth has opened the door for not only a more material reading of Burke (as offered by Hawhee, for example), but an understanding grounded in a speculative, material sacred rhetoric.

Pursuing such an understanding, however, will require two steps to reorient the study of Burke’s religious thought. First, we must understand the religious Burke with greater precision. Although Appel and Booth have begun this work, neither offers a satisfying account of what makes Burke such a complex and confusing religious thinker, nor how he can be constructively used to further understanding of religious rhetoric more generally. Appel’s account suffers from an overly linguistic cast, as I previously argued, and though Booth’s account has paved the way for a more constructive understanding of Burke, reading Burke through Taylor can help us add detail to his account, providing concepts which build on Booth’s understanding of Burke’s religion to create a more detailed picture of Burke’s religious outlook. Such a picture will help us understand why the field’s preoccupation with the critical, linguistic Burke of *RR* is a problem for religious rhetoric.

Second, we must re-center the field’s understanding of Burke’s religious thought from its current preoccupation with the *RR* to an approach that starts with *PC.* As I have already shown, the field manifests an outsized influence for *RR* where religious topics are concerned. Shifting that influence will require an understanding of the *RR* and the causes of its limitations, which I will discuss here with reference Taylor’s understanding of modernity. Taylor’s account of the modern phenomenon he calls “cross pressure” can help us understand the shortcomings of the *RR* for a speculative sacred rhetoric. We can then turn to *PC* as Burke’s key work on religion, offering a framework for understanding religion amenable to a speculative treatment of the topic. Where *RR* displays an overwhelming focus on language and the secular, a focus that has lead Burkean scholarship on religion to the same tendencies, *PC* has a more holistic approach, integrating action and motion alike into its discussion and deploying concepts that cut across the religious/secular binary. Accordingly, I argue that *PC* offers a better way forward for understanding Burke’s contribution to a speculative sacred rhetoric.

### The Cross-pressured Kenneth Burke

The best way to make sense of Burke’s religious thought (or lack thereof), I believe, lies in Taylor’s concept of “cross pressure.” Taylor defines cross pressure as a uniquely modern experience with regard to one’s position on issues of controversy, particularly religious controversy. Those who experience cross pressure feel that their beliefs are “fragilized,” that is, vulnerable to questioning or invalidation by other perspectives. In particular, cross pressured beliefs are those which “define themselves at least partly in relation to” the most extreme stances, such as fundamentalism (676). Such an experience may lead to religious ideas and practices that diverge significantly from traditional paradigms both in the content and form of the belief, though cross-pressured individual may not perceive them as such. Moreover, cross pressured religion, caught as it is between warring impulses, may not possess a high degree of consistency, as particular tenets or actions move in reaction to the influence of more extreme positions. For example, a cross pressured evangelical might feel a strong impulse to proselytize, might even feel guilt for not doing so, due to strongly-held beliefs about the necessity of belief in Christ for eternal salvation. Yet the same individual, when pressed, might be reluctant to straightforwardly endorse the belief that faithful Muslims are bound for Hell. Such attitudes, Taylor would argue, do not reflect intellectual weakness, but rather show that the person is torn by powerful, opposed social and ideological influences. Another example, perhaps more pertinent to Burke’s case, would be figures like Matthew Arnold, Thomas Hardy, and A.E. Housman, who, though unable to believe in religion, elevate the aesthetic to fill its place (607). Such figures are torn between what they feel to be rationality and a powerful need for the world to retain a sense of purpose, glory, and fullness. Cross pressure thus shapes modern religious life for believers and unbelievers alike, to say nothing of those who (like Burke) are difficult to fit into either category.

For Burke, these challenges shape his thought in a way that makes it both fruitful and frustrating for future use. The opening of *RR* illustrates this vividly. Burke opens *RR* with what amounts to a critique of religion as an ostensible center for human existence, commenting that “nothing can more effectively set people at odds than the demand that they think alike” (v). He argues that individual persons will inevitably understand doctrines individually, leading to different conceptions of God. From this critique, he moves somewhat abruptly to articulate his understanding of religion as a system of persuasion, a rhetoric which aims to form attitudes aimed at certain acts (v). Quickly he narrows the scope of this inquiry to religious terminology, describing theology as “preeminently *verbal*” and outlining his well-known logological thesis (vi).

Having used his Foreword to critique religion and narrow the subject of his inquiry to language, Burke’s Introduction to *RR* partakes more of his own idiosyncratic theology, focused on sacrifice and order (as seen in the *Rhetoric of Motives*), though expressed in Burke’s own inimitable way. He arrives at that point, however, only after careful secularization of his subject:

It is not within the competence of our project to decide the question of God’s existence either theistically or atheistically, or even agnostically. This investigation does not require us to make any decisions about the validity of theology *qua* theology. Our purpose is simply to ask how theological principles can be shown to have usable secular analogues that throw light upon the nature of language. (2)

Here, it seems to me, the logologer doth protest too much. Burke writes *RR* near the end of his life as a publisher of books, though not his corporeal life as a whole. His earlier works, including *PC* and the *Rhetoric of Motives,* make extensive use of religious ideas without in any way setting Burke up as a theologian or apologist. Who can this statement be directed to? Was there really an audience looking to Burke for a straightforward argument about the existence of God? Unlikely. Instead, what we see here is a paradigmatic moment of cross pressured thinking. Burke must distance himself from controversies regarding a/theism, even when his topic really has little to do with such discourse.

Although illustrative, this is a relatively trivial example. However, when we turn to larger concerns in the *RR,* the effects of the modern cross pressure become even clearer. Though I have shown how Burke has been understood as essentially a critical thinker, even those scholars who identify him as such, like Rueckert, acknowledge his fascination with religion and theology. Burke never debunks religion, reducing it to social or psychological forces, but instead assumes that religion tells us something real about how the world works. From the beginning of *RR,* he pursues the idea that there might be “fruitful analogies” between the realm of religion and that of logology (1). Burke’s project here is not to explain religion (away) or to set it in the context of other orders of motivation, to show how it is “really” about language. Rather, he assumes religion to be an entity in its own right, one that might tell the logologer something about the realm of his own concern. Far from treating Augustine or the Book of Genesis critically, as cloaking their true motivations in the language of religion, Burke takes them seriously as sources of rhetorical thought.

Looking more closely at *RR,* however, even this engagement with religion appears as cross-pressured, particularly through Burke’s deployment of a natural/supernatural binary. Though Burke’s emphasis is on the interplay between these two realms, his essential position maintains a sense of priority, as seen by his claim that “the words for the ‘supernatural’ realm are necessarily borrowed from the realm of our everyday experiences” (*RR* 7). Though Burke is careful to insist that religious words can also become secularized, he does not view this as a “necessary” connection. Indeed, if the sacred-to-secular transition were necessary, there would be no need for *RR.* Burke thus assumes that the natural world, what he will elsewhere refer to as the realm of the “empirical,” is necessarily prior to an experience of the sacred (37).[^21] Though Burke never sets out to debunk or reduce religion, the priority he assumes for the empirical over the religious is debatable at best, and compromises the value of his work for a speculative sacred rhetoric.

Burke’s belief in the necessary priority of the natural positions him in opposition to a fully embodied notion of religion, joining with his more serious approach to the topic to reveal him as cross pressured. Taylor has identified the natural/supernatural binary as a quintessential product of cross-pressured modernity, noting that the “hiving off of an independent, free-standing level, that of ‘nature,’ which may or may not be in interaction with something further or beyond, is a crucial bit of modern theorizing, which in turn corresponds to a constitutive dimension of modern experience” (14). For Taylor, the theory of a free-standing nature constitutes modernity because people in previous eras experienced the world as “enchanted”—that is, no experience, however mundane, was without a sacred dimension.[^22] Spiritual forces of good and evil were always at work, and people made sense of their world—from natural phenomena to personal emotions to social relations—in those terms. For Taylor, only such an account makes sense of premodern activities like the village activity of “beating the bounds”—walking the boundaries of the parish on certain feasts to hold back the forces of evil (43). In a world with such beliefs and activities, the notion that natural experiences are prior to supernatural ones is not only wrong, but incoherent.

Cross pressured modernity, however, both relies upon a natural/supernatural binary and reinforces it. For Taylor, whereas the premodern experience of the world was characterized by the “porous” self, a sense that one’s life and very person were open to the influence of spiritual forces beyond our understanding, in modernity we have created “the buffered self,” a sense of personhood as self-contained and immutable to spiritual forces (27). Even those of us who believe in supernatural forces do not experience them as active in our very selves in the way that premodern people, who believed in the real possibility of (say) demon possession, did. We do not beat the bounds or (generally) feel moved to take other steps to protect ourselves or our communities from supernatural forces. Instead, a variety of factors, from the epistemological theories of people like Descartes to an expanded vocabulary of the inner life, have combined to leave us buffered from the spiritual forces people once experienced: where our ancestors would see demon possession, even the most devout of us now would diagnose mental illness, something purely internal to the person rather than the invasion of an external spiritual force. For Taylor, this buffered self shapes our experience of the world so deeply that “older holistic understandings of society \[become\] less and less believable, even in the end nigh incomprehensible” (541). A world in which a person can become inexplicably taken over by demonic forces is so alien to our experience that understanding it without a reductive move (suggesting, for instance, that premodern people simply didn’t understand mental illness) is incredibly difficult. Taylor’s solution to this is not that we should become devout, premodern people (even if that were possible), but rather that we must acknowledge that distinction in the clearest possible terms.[^23] A strong binary between natural and supernatural defined as a metaphysical reality, then, at the least makes historical understandings of religious rhetoric more difficult than necessary.

Burke’s deployment of the natural/supernatural binary thus compromises the quality of his engagement with religion. This internal strife becomes all the more apparent when we turn to the central concern of *RR,* language. Though Hawhee has made a compelling case that bodies and the material are a persistent concern of Burke’s across his life, her only comment on *RR* is to agree with what she sees as Joshua Gunn’s judgment that it stresses the spiritual too much (31). This is despite the fact that Hawhee argues strenuously that Burke did not abandon or “get over” his interest in bodies in his later work (106). Gunn himself “part\[s\] ways” with Burke in order to pursue a more expansive notion of the rhetoric of religion: he accepts Burke’s analysis of the rhetoric of religion as centered upon an experience of “ineffability” or transcendence, but argues that such experiences take place everywhere in the world, not just in the supernatural (xxi). For Gunn, “our experience of the world—what we see, hear, touch, smell, taste, and feel—is fundamentally ineffable,” and thus the rhetoric of religion should not be limited to theology but applies to all kinds of experiences (xxi-xxii). Hawhee and Gunn alike thus see Burke’s emphasis upon language in the context of religion as too limiting, a judgment with which I concur, and proceed accordingly: Hawhee to engage his work on bodies while largely disregarding the *RR,* and Gunn to develop his own work on the occult.

Burke’s troubles with the question of religious language can be illustrated by three paragraphs in the forward to *RR*, in which Burke defines his project. After beginning with some reflections on what we might call the varieties of religious experience, Burke moves to explain the title of the work: “The subject of religion falls under the head of rhetoric in the sense that rhetoric is the art of persuasion, and religious cosmogonies are designed, in the last analysis, as exceptionally thoroughgoing modes of persuasion. To persuade men towards certain acts, religions would form the kinds of attitude which prepare men for such acts” (v). In this initial definition, Burke describes the rhetoric of religion as the study of how religions form attitudes to prepare for acts. This definition aligns closely with the approach to sacred rhetoric I outlined in my introduction: attitude-forming, after all, can take place through both action and motion. Discursive systems clearly form attitudes, but so does–in a very literal sense–the direction your body is positioned in. So this definition would seem to work well to account for not just dogma and theology, but all the other ways that religion forms attitudes: liturgies, architecture, and the like.

Unfortunately, Burke will ultimately undo the usefulness of this definition, and set himself against his own comprehensiveness. After a second paragraph reaffirming the rhetorical nature of religion, Burke turns in the third paragraph to a more detailed, and unfortunately more reductive, consideration of his project: “Furthermore, in this book we are to be concerned not directly with religion, but rather with the *terminology* of religion; not directly with man’s relationship to God, but rather with his relationship to the *word* ‘God’ (vi). Thereafter, Burke pursues not in fact a rhetoric of religion, but rather a rhetoric of theology, deriving his understanding of the subject from complex works of theological reflection rather than some more mundane aspects of religion. By limiting his focus to the terminology of religion, Burke undoes the comprehensiveness of his earlier definition, and sidelines the attitude-forming power of the more material elements of religion: bread, wine, steeples, pews.

Especially considered in light of scholarship like Hawhee’s, the linguistic focus of *RR* might be perplexing. However, this is where an understanding of Burke as cross pressured especially bears fruit. Much like his protestations in the Introduction that he will not decide the question of a/theism, Burke’s retreat to language in *RR* can be read as an attempt to operate in a realm free of the controversies of modernity. Burke focuses on language, in other words, because he does not wish to engage in modern controversies over the metaphysical reality of religion—does not wish to argue with the apologists or the skeptics. This is certainly understandable, even if it limits the value of *RR* for the more speculative rhetoric that I seek to establish.

We can see this cross pressured effect even more clearly in Booth’s reflections on Burke’s religion. Speaking as a friend and student of Burke’s, Booth attempts to reveal Burke as a truly religious thinker, albeit in terms marked by cross pressure. In labeling Burke a “disguised theologian,” Booth both seeks to position Burke as a true believer in an ontologically real divine being, and to distance him from conventional religion. His definition of religion as a belief in a “power that confusingly but genuinely commands of us that we pursue its nature” is a quintessentially cross pressured notion, as it both seeks to legitimize Burke (and Booth) as truly religious, yet distances them from traditional beliefs (“Many Voices,” 195).

Moreover, Booth seems to share my analysis that the linguistic focus of *RR* was an aberration. After describing how Burke found deconstruction’s single-minded focus on language too simple, Booth offers a preface to *RR* designed to stress that the linguistic reductivism of the book does not reflect the true Burke, declaring that “KB knew that he was grappling not just with language about reality but with the reality of value distinctions and their mysterious source at the top” (“Kenneth Burke’s Religious Rhetoric,” 39). For Booth, the source of the reductivism would appear to be KB’s discomfort with his own status as a prophet and theologian of that “mysterious source.” In other words, by attempting to bracket God in *RR*–out of a refusal to get into the question of God’s existence–Burke ends up bracketing the entire immanent realm. Cross pressure thus leads Burke away from his own best instincts in *RR* and toward something closer to a critical, reductive stance.

These cross pressured tendencies suggest that beginning the field of religious rhetoric with *RR* is unproductive. Where scholars tend to make *RR* definitive of Burke’s work on religion, or, worse, to call it the culmination of his life’s work (see Wess 217, citing Rueckert), we need to recognize how cross pressure in fact makes it an unusual and highly problematic text, subject to binaries and a focus on language that leave it compromised for a more embodied understanding of religion. Far from a paradigmatic work on religion or Burke’s most comprehensive treatment of the subject, understanding the book as a product of cross pressure shows it to be limited in its applicability to different religious rhetorics. Most stories of sacred rhetoric, as I have shown earlier in this chapter and in my introduction, begin with *RR,* yet given its conflicted treatment of religion it is hard to see why this should be so. Accordingly, if Burke is to continue to have a place in this discussion, we must look to other works.

### *Permanence and Change*: Refounding the Rhetoric of Religion

Instead, we need to begin the study of sacred rhetoric with a more comprehensive treatment of the subject, and one which is not primarily driven by a response to cross pressure. Without ignoring or simply repudiating the influence of cross pressure, we need nonetheless to begin with a mode of thought that is not primarily driven by the conflicts and uncertainties of cross pressured religion. To pursue such a rhetoric would be to embrace what Latour calls a “nonmodern” attitude, “which deploys instead of unveiling, adds instead of subtracting, fraternizes instead of denouncing, sorts out instead of debunking” (*WHNBM* 47). For Latour, this non-critical, non-secular approach acknowledges the contributions of modernity without being driven by them, either in affirmation or rejection. Instead, nonmodern thought takes modern viewpoints into account, but historicizes and relativizes them as the cultural constructs they are. This is not to say that they are not real, but that they are not absolute or the only way to understand the world.

Achieving such a nonmodern rhetoric of religion does not mean abandoning Burke, though it does imply turning away from *RR* as the sole foundation of the field. Burke himself was hardly a debunker, as his lifelong interest in and sincere engagement with religion shows. However, *RR* is unable to offer a truly nonmodern understanding of religion due to cross pressure, which drives the work to center on the quintessentially (post)modern theme of language. In contrast, *PC* manifests a less cross pressured understanding of religion, and thus takes up religious concepts in a way that is more amenable to nonmodern appropriation.

Burke’s more holistic understanding of religion in *PC* is attributable, I believe, to the lessened influence of cross pressure on the book as compared to *RR.* Where in *RR* Burke takes up religion directly, and thus seems to feel himself bound to (somewhat) directly address debates between theists and atheists, in *PC* Burke adopts religious ideas as useful contributors to an explanation of human motivation and action in general. The ostensibly “secular” focus of the work may thus have preserved it from the need to explicitly shape the discussion in response to cross pressure, allowing Burke’s essentially robust and subtle understanding of religion to act as it should.

Though *PC* has seldom been analyzed as a source for Burke’s religious thought, in fact the book offers nothing less than dramatism as serious engagement with religion. This can be seen, first of all, in the work’s concept of *orientation*, which offers a compelling understanding of motives that is strongly resistant to any reductive moves. In the simplest terms, an orientation consists of the bundle of judgments that create a self-perpetuating interpretation of the world. Burke insists that “all living things are critics,” meaning that they interpret the signs that they experience around them (5). Any such interpretation “tends to become a self-perpetuating structure, creating the measures by which it shall be measured. It moves to form a closed circle, though individual or class divergencies ever tend to break the regularity of this circle. . . . In the simplest summary, let us say that *we have been attempting to consider the many ramifications implicit in the statement that ’our thoughts and acts are affected by our interests’*” (262). An orientation thus consists of the many ways in which beings interpret their surroundings, which reinforce one another through action and motivation. Although Burke’s purpose is to explore how these systems are motivated by personal interests, in so doing he is not attempting to debunk these orientations or reduce them to something unethical. On the contrary, for Burke those motivations are precisely ethical insofar as they are system-building, since he defines the ethical not by any particular group of moral teachings, but simply as the impulse to build systems, to link ideas and rules in order to create a coherent interpretation of experience.

This notion of orientation and the ethical can be seen in a Burke’s discussion of the ideas of piety and impiety, which impulses structure the ethical formation of orientations. Piety and impiety are neither specifically religious nor secular concepts in *PC,* but explanatory tools that operate powerfully in both realms—thus showing any hard division between the two to be impossible. Burke demonstrates this most clearly in a discussion of a hypothetical case in which a man trained in the thought of the Church is dismissed in Freudian, classically critical terms as giving a mere “rationalization” of his actions. Burke, himself deeply influenced by Freud (see Davis), nonetheless offers a stinging response: “Why this man should have been suspected of self-deception when using the only vocabulary of motives he had ever been taught, will remain one of the mysteries of psycho-analytic rationalization. It would seem somewhat like accusing a savage of self-deception who, never having heard of Pasteur, attempted to cure his disease without the orientation of bacteriology” (18). Though the metaphor here is certainly rather condescending, in fact the argument is a defense of religious orientations. Burke places the Churchman on the same level as the Freudian, as one explaining his motives in the vocabulary he has been taught. Both the Churchman and the Freudian exhibit piety to their own orientations, and are thus analogous in how they employ their own vocabularies of motives to make sense of the world. Burke thus engages sincerely, not critically, with religious thought, showing the tendency of his notion of orientation to resist a critical, debunking move.

Similarly, Burke takes to task those who would interpret Augustine’s religious impulses in *Confessions* as sublimated sexuality:

> By what authority can one call them the essence of his motivation? Non-sexual interests may be interpreted as the symbolization of sexual interests—but then again, sexual interests may themselves be considered as the symbolization of non-sexual interests. . . . What, except the strong sexual orientation of our society, in contrast with the strong religious orientation of Saint Augustine’s society, determines which shall be called the true motive and which the symbolic accretion? (27).

Here again, Burke treats religious and non-religious orientations as equal for motivational purposes: neither is more true, basic, or real than the other. Neither natural nor supernatural explanation is prior to the other; neither psychology nor religion explains the other, but each offers its own “terminology of motives” that is “not evasive or self-deceptive, but is moulded to fit our general orientation as to purposes, instrumentalities, the ‘good life,’ etc.” (29). For Burke, explaining what motivates, say, Augustine to hold his views is not to debunk or explain away his point of view, but to seek a more detailed understanding of the situation which gives rise to his orientation. The orientation itself is a response to a given situation, and Burke resists the attempts of those, like psychoanalysts, who would reduce such responses to a simple motive from another vocabulary. Contrasting religion and psychoanalysis, he wryly observes that “one school’s reason is another’s rationalization” (20). Burke in *PC* thus resists reductive moves which would explain religion as a function of any other force, whether the libido of the psychoanalysts, “the social” of social constructionists like McCutcheon, or the language that some Burkeans think drive his own understanding of religion. Burke’s concepts of orientation and piety/impiety thus offer a resource for resisting those secularizing, critical moves which would reduce religion to an expression of the social.

Furthermore, Burke’s notion of orientation in *PC* resists the linguistic reductivism which some Burkeans have allowed to define his whole take on religion. Unlike logology as it is conventionally understood, orientation assumes the motivational importance of the body and the material as well as language and culture. Burke’s initial definition of the term in fact links it to the most basic biological drives:

> In a general way, we might say that events take character by a “linkage of outstanding with outstanding” (as the outstanding sound of the bell, in linkage with the outstanding experience of the food, imparted to the bell a food-character for Pavlov’s dogs). The accumulation and interworking of such characters is an orientation. It forms the basis of *expectancy*—for character telescopes the past, present, and future. . . . Orientation is thus a bundle of judgments as to how things were, how they are, and how they may be. The act of response, as implicated in the character which an event has for us, shows clearly the integral relationship between our metaphysics and our conduct. For in a statement as to how the world is, we have implicit judgments not only as to how the world may become but also as to what means we should employ to make it so. (14)

If orientation is response, a “bundle of judgments,” or “implicit,” it is not exclusively linguistic or cognitive. Rather, it resides in our guts, in our less than conscious responses to the world around us. Religion is in no small part about breeding such responses, whether through its moral teachings (“abhor what is evil,” says St. Paul in Romans 12:9) or through the manifold ways that it tries to foster an attitude of reverence toward God (bells, incense, vestments, architecture). The response that religion aims to create thus looks more like the linking of metaphysics and conduct described here than the purely linguistic focus on “complex theories of transcendence” in *RR.* This is not to banish the analysis of theology or religious language from our study, but rather to set them in their proper context as the creations of desiring, embodied human beings. In the study of religion, linguistic systems (theology, doctrine) and embodied actions have a dynamic relation and neither determines the other. *PC*’s notion of orientation, I believe, is better suited to account for this relation than *RR’s* sole focus on theology. Accordingly, further constructive work in the field that draws on Burke ought to look at least as much to *PC* as it does to *RR.*

Similarly, Burke’s endorsement in *PC* of the concept of “secular conversion” also cuts against a stark secular/religious binary, including the priority given to the empirical in *RR.* In the central section of *PC* where he discusses this concept, Burke deploys the Christian concept of conversion to explain psychoanalysis, a delightful inversion of the more critical tendencies of figures like Freud. We should note the conjunctions here: “Even so virtuous a faith as Christianity situated the crux of conversion, not in *goodness,* but in *belief.* So we need not be surprised to find evidence that, in the secular rebirth engineered by the psychoanalytic seer, the processes of recovery . . . are closely interwoven with a shifting of one’s intellectualistic convictions” (125). Here Burke positions psychoanalysis as a kind of faith of its own—a system of beliefs and practices deriving from fundamental human motives. Christianity and psychoanalysis are set in parallel with one another and found to share common motives. Later, in a discussion of scientific and Nietzschean searches for the purpose of humanity, Burke equates any system that tries to change people’s minds with a faith: “Every system of exhortation hinges about some definite act of faith, a deliberate selection of alternatives” (235). Burke notes that this is true of his own system as well, admitting that Burkeans, evolutionary scientists, and Christian believers all make their own leaps of faith—none explains or accounts for the other, but all share in this common human activity. By eliminating any sense of priority or hierarchy in which kind of phenomenon receives explanatory power, *PC* shows itself to have a subtler notion of secularity than the *RR.*

In addition to working against a reductive take on religion through his holistic notions of orientation, piety, and conversion, Burke’s revised edition of *PC* challenges received notions of secularity that contribute to critical takes on religion. Where *RR* assumes religion to be a secondary accretion developed over the experiences of “natural” life, in the third edition of *PC,* Burke takes a subtler approach to the question of secularization, one that aligns him well with Taylor. This critique of secularization further aligns the work with *PC*’s resistance to linguistic reductivism.

This can be seen by considering Taylor’s response to secularization theory. Taylor’s great project is to examine and refine the discussion over mainstream secularization theory: the accounts of how and why Western culture has become secularized in modernity. Although the traditional story of secularization is one of simple loss, Taylor wants to make clear that secularity is in fact an achievement, something that didn’t just happen but that was forged through great effort. James K.A. Smith summarizes the point well when he describes Taylor’s claim that the secular age “is not merely privative. The emergence of the secular is also bound up with the production of a new option—the possibility of exclusive humanism as a viable social imaginary—a way of constructing meaning and significance without any reference to the divine or transcendence” (26). The existence of people who are without religion, in other words, depends upon society finding narratives and ways of life to support them. Taylor’s term “social imaginary” designates “the way that we collectively imagine, even pre-theoretically, our social life” (Taylor 146). A social imaginary thus provides a way of making sense of the world, even on an unconscious or unreflective level, and the systems in which we are able to see the possibilities available for our lives, as well as the roles we can fill in society and ways we can seek out a good life. Without a secular social imaginary—which must necessarily be a positive achievement rather than a product of mere loss—the secular age cannot come into being. Any appropriately postsecular rhetoric, then, must not position religion as the prior state to a more enlightened secularism, nor must it assume that secularity is simply “real” while religion is socially constructed. Per Taylor, both religion and secularism are constructed social imaginaries.

Here too, though in a complex manner, *PC* can help us create a more speculative sacred rhetoric, one which would acknowledge the constructed nature of both religion and the secular. Burke’s understanding of secularization shifted over the course of his life, as reflected in his updated prologue to *PC,* dated 1953. In that prologue, Burke offers a revision to one of the key sections on religion in *PC*:

> A major reservation should be made with regard to the section on “Magic, Religion, and Science.” The stress here seems much too “historicist” for the author’s present preferences. Rather than thinking of magic, religion, and science as three distinctly successive *stages* in the world’s history, the author would now use a mode of analysis that dealt with all three as aspects of motivation “forever born anew” in the resources of language as such. (lix)

Whereas the original text of the “Magic, Religion, and Science” section sees science as inevitably supplanting religion in a secularizing process, Burke’s later revision places these forces parallel to one another as motivational forces. Such an approach cuts against mainstream secularization theory in alignment with Taylor’s project. In Burke’s revision, science and secular forces do not supplant religion in a historical progression, but both the religious and the secular are parallel forces operating in language and culture together. The secularization of modernity thus appears not as the inevitable loss of religion due to historical progression, but rather as the temporary dominance of one perennial force over another—a dominance which will not necessarily continue unabated, but which might ebb and flow. Burke’s revision positions both religion and science as constructed forces, much as Taylor has them, and both must be understood as ever-important aspects of human motivation.

For a speculative sacred rhetoric, *PC* thus offers a position which helps us evade the reductive forces of secularization theory, as well as providing a set of concepts in orientation, piety/impiety, and conversion which neither reduce religion to some other force nor position it as wholly separate from other forms of human culture. As noted in my introduction, arguing for a speculative sacred rhetoric does not imply pigeonholing religion in its own domain of knowledge, free of influence from other realms—to do so would be to reduce religion to a private experience not subject to scholarly inquiry, which is hardly my goal or reflective of the phenomenon as a whole. Instead, we must seek rhetorical tools and concepts that are well-suited to religious modes of thought and being, aimed neither at reducing religion nor isolating it. In *PC,* rhetoricians have a Burke whose analysis is better-suited to these goals than the Burke typically derived from a reading focused on *RR.*

### Orientation and Conversion

Although I will make more extensive use of ideas drawn from *PC* in my counter-history of the field (chapter four), by way of a conclusion it is worth spending a moment considering how one of these ideas might be applied. In particular, Burke’s notion of orientation offers an extremely valuable resource for religious rhetoric, one that can be fruitfully applied to consider the question of conversion—how a person is moved from one religious point of view to another.[^24] Burke provides some hints regarding how this application might work himself, but his ideas can be further applied.

After defining orientation (as quoted above) as “a bundle of judgments” about events that shape one’s experience of time and appropriate courses of action, Burke offers the example of racially inflected scapegoating as a negative, erroneous orientation: poor whites who feel economically disenfranchised enact “a reading from ‘what is’ \[economic disenfranchisement\] to ‘what may be,’” an attempt to redress the balance through lynching (15). Though Burke emphatically views these means of accomplishing the goal as erroneous, he insists that “there is no evidence of an evasive process here distinguishable in its mental functioning from some non-scapegoat or realistic way of response” (15). The formation of an orientation, in other words, whether reasonable or unreasonable, proceeds according to the same process: a bundle of judgments about past experience cohere into a viewpoint about the desired future, and about the appropriate actions to get there.

For Burke, critique of an orientation from without cannot invalidate it, since that very critique proceeds from its own orientation. It can only identify “a different way of linkage” to different experiences which might model a revised orientation (16). It would thus be fruitless to approach a set of white supremacists and to attempt to persuade them to become economists or policy wonks. “Converting” such people would instead mean suggesting new linkages within their orientation itself, promoting change within the orientation toward more constructive ways of addressing their need for a better future—a new understanding of “what is” and “what may be.” Conversion thus is less about radical or wholesale change than about the realization that one’s orientation has linkages one would not expect—and that those linkages demand a realignment in other aspects of life, such as one’s religious affiliation.

We can illustrate this process of orientation and reorientation by examining one of the most famous Christian conversions of the twentieth century: that of C. S. Lewis. Sketching in an understanding of Lewis’s conversion may help us grasp the potential of *PC* for a new rhetoric of religion, so although this will not be a fully worked-out notion of Lewis, it should be informative with regard to Burke. Whereas conversion narratives are often characterized by the drawing of extreme contrasts between the convert’s life before and after conversion—Augustine’s *Confessions* provides perhaps the most famous example of this genre, with the author heavily stressing his guilt and the depraved nature of his will prior to conversion. In contrast, Lewis’s conversion narrative assumes tremendous *continuity* between his pre- and post-conversion lives.[^25] He thus serves as a compelling example of how Burke’s notion of orientation helps explain religious conversion in cases where the extreme contrasts of the Augustinian model may not apply.

This continuity between Lewis’s pre- and post-conversion lives has frequently been remarked upon, although it has not been linked to the rhetoric of conversion. His friend Owen Barfield claimed that “somehow what he thought about everything was secretly present in what he said about anything” (quoted in Jacobs, xxi). Barfield argues that though Lewis wrote in a tremendously wide range of genres, his understanding of how the world works—Burke’s “bundle of judgments”—was prone to continually resurface in everything from his scholarship on medieval literature to children’s writings. Lewis’s biographer Alan Jacobs agrees, and argues that “Lewis’s mind was above all characterized by a *willingness to be enchanted* and that it was this openness to enchantment that held together the various strands of his life” (xxi). For Jacobs, this willingness to be enchanted was a characteristic of Lewis’s both before and after his conversion. Lewis’s friend Adam Bede Griffiths, O.S.B., too, argues that Lewis’s lifelong fascination with myth both contributed to his conversion and gave coherence to his whole life. Noting that Lewis was converted in part because he came to see Christianity as a “true myth,” Griffiths argues that “this understanding of the relation between myth and history was the key to Lewis’s conversion to Christianity and in a sense to his whole life” (Griffiths 83). Griffiths, who corresponded extensively with Lewis when both were going through conversions, links this theme of myth to Lewis’s love of, on the one hand, stories of Siegfried and the Twilight of the Gods, and on the other, the Christian allegories of George MacDonald. Lewis’s conversion, then, has widely been understood as a case of continuity rather than rupture between his pre- and post-conversion selves, and thus as a fitting case study for Burke’s notion of orientation.

Lewis’s own account of his conversion in *Surprised by Joy*[^26] centers its account of orientation on Lewis’s notion of “joy,” understood as a complex aesthetic and emotional phenomenon that propelled him toward Christianity while also residing primarily in his pre-Christian life.[^27] Lewis recounts his first experiences of joy as a child in the following way: “I desired with almost sickening intensity something never to be described (except that it is cold, spacious, severe, pale, and remote) and then, as in the other examples, found myself at the very same moment already falling out of that desire and wishing I were back in it” (17). Joy, in his account, has something in common with the experience of beauty, but more specifically in involves desire that cannot be satisfied. He also uses the German term *Sehnsucht* for this experience, referring to intense longing for the unattainable. Lewis also terms this sense one of Romanticism, but though by virtue of training and personality Lewis cannot avoiding giving the experience a literary cast, it is more than an experience of art (see Jasper 223). This experience is so foundational for Lewis that he describes himself as having spent many years pursuing it; and indeed, the very title of his conversion narrative references it.

Lewis builds up his account of joy by describing a series of experiences from reading Beatrix Potter’s *Squirrel Nutkin,* to the loss of his mother at an early age, to seeing a toy garden his brother had built, to his encounters with the Northern mythology of Balder. As the narrative progresses, the search for joy and the experience of it shape Lewis’s whole life, from his choice of profession, as a student of the medieval and renaissance literature where joy reached him most readily, to his ultimate conversion. Yet due to the spontaneous and overwhelming nature of the experience, Lewis comes to learn that he cannot obtain it by hunting for it: “I had no lure to which the bird would come” (166). Conscious effort to pursue joy only made the sensation more elusive—he only encountered it when it took him by surprise, as the book’s title suggests. Joy might thus be understood for Lewis as a Burkean orientation, a response—however spontaneous—to a “bundle of judgments” previously made, and one which provides a viewpoint about future actions and the means of accomplishing them. Rather than a conscious ideological structure, for Lewis joy was a response to certain stimuli, one that came about largely without his intention or will, though it drew upon existing aesthetic and intellectual judgments.

Perhaps most important in making a case for Lewis’s experience of joy as Burkean orientation is the persistence of the experience before and after his conversion. Lewis’s account is emphatically not a tale of discarding an ostensibly pagan experience in service of a higher religious passion, but rather of the discovery of what Lewis would term the real purpose of joy, never fully intuited until his conversion. Though Lewis is careful to insist that his imaginative experiences “would never have made me either wiser or better,” he argues forcefully that his Christian and imaginative experiences “reflect” one another, and that joy has “the shape of the reality it reflected” (167). That is, his conversion stemmed not from a rejection of his past desires, but from a belief that they were fulfilled and realized only in his acceptance of Christian faith. Ultimately, Lewis comes to see the desire that constitutes joy as a desire for the Other: “Inexorably Joy proclaimed ‘You want—I myself am your want of—something other, outside, not you nor any state of you.’ I did not yet ask, Who is the desired? only What is it?” (221). For the mature Lewis, looking back on his youthful experiences of joy, it seems clear that they were pointed to God before he was drawn to faith. Lewis’s realization that he could not force himself to experience joy thus leads him to understand it as an impulse taking him beyond atheism to theism and a desire for the Other. Joy thus takes him from atheism to theism, and his interest in myth (merely another species of his interest in joy, as that is the primary value he finds in myths) later takes him from theism to Christianity. When figures like Jacobs or Griffiths argue that Lewis’s whole life was made sense of by his conversion, then, they are arguing that his search to find an object for the ineffable desire of joy—a search which he carried on for his entire pre-conversion life—was finally realized. If Lewis’s orientation was shifted by adding new linkages—to Christ, to the church—the basic structure, his original “bundle of judgments” about the world remained largely intact. This is not to deny that something changes in the moment of conversion—to insist that Lewis did not change at all. Rather, it is simply to locate the change somewhere else than we might think. Lewis’s conversion was not just an intellectual move, the rejection of certain doctrines and the acceptance of others, but an intuitive change that remained in continuity with his emotional life prior to conversion. For all Lewis’s formidable intellectual profile as an Oxford don, his conversion thus primarily derives not from “complex theories of transcendence” but from an intuitive reaction to his experience of the world.

Lewis thus serves as a compelling example of how Burke’s notion of orientation can help us understand certain religious conversions. Moreover, we can see that Burke’s idea is amenable to a speculative sacred rhetoric because far from debunking or reducing Lewis’s own account of his religious change, with orientation we can in fact take that account seriously, merely adding detail and rigor to its interpretation. An analysis of *Surprised by Joy* based upon the logology of *RR* would not look to Lewis’s account for an understanding of conversion, but would instead translate Lewis’s concept of joy (words about God) into a secular rhetorical concept (words about words). Moreover, by beginning with complex theories of transcendence, a logological approach to understanding Lewis might find his conversion to be about ideas like Romanticism. In contrast, an interpretation based upon *PC* can speak about Lewis’s conversion *as conversion,* finding in it a valuable case study of how orientation operates in Lewis’s sacred rhetoric. Accordingly, a speculative sacred rhetoric must begin with the latter.

## Chapter Three: Bruno Latour: Person-giving Rhetoric

> The revival in religion will be a rhetorical problem—new persuasive words for defaced or degraded ones. - Thornton Wilder, as quoted by Paul Zahl, Bill Borror, and Scott Jones (see Zahl; Borror and Jones).

I concluded my consideration of Kenneth Burke in the previous chapter by putting forward Burke’s notion of orientation as preferable to his better-known project of logology in forging what I am calling a speculative sacred rhetoric. Burke’s theory of orientation, I argued, offers resources for understanding conversion narratives without reducing religion to a purely ideological force, as logology tends to do. At the same time, the limitations of Burke’s *RR* suggest that rhetorical scholarship must draw on other theorists to further build a speculative notion of the field. Accordingly, my attention now turns to Bruno Latour, whose work has garnered attention in rhetorical scholarship, and who offers a compelling notion of religion that informs and furthers my case for a speculative sacred rhetoric. If Burke can help us understand the rhetoric of conversion through his notion of orientation, Latour’s understanding of religion as “person-giving or presence-enhancing,” worked out alongside his analysis of modernity in general, provides a valuable complementary approach to the task of sacred rhetoric. Latour is therefore an essential thinker for pushing the field toward a better set of conceptual tools for understanding sacred rhetoric.

Latour’s influence on rhetoric has grown as rhetoricians have sought out thinkers who can renew our understanding of rhetoric, humanity, and the intellectual life in a moment Terry Eagleton has described as “after theory”—that is, an era in which the critical techniques of postmodern theory and the standard topics of race, class, and gender have become so familiar that the field begins to cast about for new methods or areas of inquiry (see Eagleton 1-3). Latour himself has contributed to this discourse by asking why critique has “run out of steam” and putting forth a “compositionist’s [rather than a critic’s] manifesto.” Rhetoricians have therefore turned to Latour for a new voice that may help us address some of the field’s most pressing concerns in light of new ideas about language, humanism, and ecology. One of these essential concerns, as I have argued thus far, ought to be religion, yet scholarship on Latour has yet to bring together consideration of rhetoric and religion, whether in the discipline of rhetoric or religious studies.

Writing on Latour from within rhetoric and composition has taken up many aspects of his work, from his study of science to his thought on modernity and his metaphysical project, yet no scholar has done a detailed analysis of his perspective on religion. The field’s most robust assessment of Latour to date comes in the collection *Thinking with Bruno Latour in Rhetoric and Composition,* a work that is wide-ranging in subject matter but that offers little discussion of religion on the whole. Editors Paul Lynch and Nathaniel Rivers acknowledge this when they note in their introduction that Latour’s first book-length consideration of religion, *Rejoicing,* came out during the process of the volume’s publication. Lynch and Rivers hint at the value of Latour’s work for a speculative sacred rhetoric by arguing that *Rejoicing* reminds us “that the religious mode of existence requires not that we speak *about* religion but speak religiously” (14). Despite this promising start, Lynch and Rivers are limited by the constraints of the introduction genre (as well as the new, and thus limited availability of the book on religion), to a brief consideration of the topic—suggesting the need for more sustained discussion that has yet to come to fruition. Lynch has also written on Latour and apocalypticism, a genre freighted with religious significance, yet he concerns himself with a broader notion of the apocalyptic that has no directly religious content. Perhaps the most sustained consideration of Latour and religion in the field comes from Marc C. Santos, who argues that Latour’s post-critical project itself would benefit from a more sustained consideration of the religious subject of transcendence (315). Santos’s argument thus has significant resonances with my own project, and I will take it up in more detail later in this chapter; however, the point stands that rhetorical studies has given religion in Latour little consideration.

Scholars of religion, meanwhile, have concerned themselves primarily with Latour’s metaphysical and sociological import, neglecting considerations of rhetoric. The most sustained analysis of Latour in the field of religion is Adam S. Miller’s monograph *Speculative Grace: Bruno Latour and Object-oriented Theology,* which offers a compelling account of Latour’s contribution to theology and metaphysics. Although Miller has a highly rhetorical approach to philosophy in his focus on contingency, materiality, and practice, his text concerns itself with metaphysics and ontology and has little explicit concern for rhetoric. Moreover, Miller’s reading of Latour would seem to reinforce those aspects of his work which are problematic for sacred rhetoric, as Miller’s notion of “speculative grace” banishes transcendence quite explicitly: for instance, he asks “Rather than being an unknowable force operating behind the scenes, might grace instead be what characterizes—here and now and in plain sight—the whole of *this* world’s self-organizing complexity?” (3). As Miller develops this localized, self-organizing notion of grace, it is clear that he has little time for transcendence of any sort, and thus little to offer in response to Santos’s rhetorical examination of Latour.

Henning Schmidgen’s intellectual biography of Latour, meanwhile, highlights the place of religious thought in Latour’s project, dedicating consideration in particular to Latour’s early work on the New Testament and the Catholic poet Charles Péguy. For Schmidgen, Latour’s interest in religion falls within his overall project considering how “knowledge, time, and society relate to one another” (3). His work on Péguy aligns with broader interests in tradition, repetition, and inscription that Schmidgen draws out deftly from Latour’s body of work. Though Schmidgen does not critically assess the place of religion in Latour’s thought—his project being to describe rather than assess—and neither does he invoke rhetoric, his analysis makes clear the centrality of religious thought to a full understanding of Latour.

As the matter stands, then, a detailed, productive assemblage (as Latour would say) of rhetoric, religion, and Latour has yet to be developed. Rhetoricians are just beginning to think through Latour’s value for our field, and his body of work is extensive and multi-faceted, so it would be ungenerous to fault the discipline for neglecting this aspect of his corpus. Instead, I will merely claim that the time has come for a project that will draw together Latour, rhetoric, and religion to more fully grasp how those domains connect and/or collide.

### A Nonmodern Rhetoric

In order to arrive at a productive conjunction of Latour, rhetoric, and religion, we need a grasp not just of Latour’s project as a whole—though we need that—but the place religion fills within it. I will thus begin my analysis by making a case for why religion has been present in Latour’s concerns all along, and why we need a grasp of Latour’s position on religion in order to understand his rhetoric. Only after having made such a case will I turn to specific consideration of the *content* of Latour’s religious analysis, his “person-giving or presence-enhancing” rhetoric, which has its greatest applicability in the religious genres of testimony or confession.

Such a project requires first of all an analysis of Latour’s examination of modernity, which drives and motivates much of his project. A good starting point is his discussion of the aerosol can in *We Have Never Been Modern* (*WHNBM*): “Press the most innocent aerosol button,” and from Latour’s perspective you are immediately entangled in a potent mixture of science, politics, religion, knowledge, power, and justice via issues of climate change, global trade, and the ethics of consumption (*WHNBM* 2). For Latour, even the simple aerosol can demonstrates that issues of science and ethics, nature and culture, cannot be disentangled from one another. Modernity, however, insists on drawing sharp lines between these entities. So-called modern societies are notable for having created such technologies—the aerosol can being an example—which draw together humans, nonhumans, and the transcendent in incredible complexity. Yet in order to proliferate these technologies, modernity must deny their existence, insisting that, for instance, anthropogenic climate change is “purely” a scientific matter. Modernity thus enforces an ontological asymmetry, both between humans and non-humans and between the transcendent (what Latour calls the “crossed-out God”) and the immanent. This asymmetry “arises first from the conjoined creation of those three entities, and then from the masking of the conjoined birth and the separate treatment of the three communities while, underneath, hybrids continue to multiply as an effect of this separate treatment” (*WHNBM* 13). Humans, nonhumans, and the crossed-out God are forced into separate ontological categories.

Yet modernity also uses these categories to create the technologies and phenomena which Latour refers to as hybrids or imbroglios, objects which mix together the three entities which should be separate. The aerosol can, in fact, touches upon the human (as a product of human invention), the nonhuman (as an object with its own limitations and affordances), and the divine (as a sign of a disregard for justice and the common world, signaled by a disregard for climate change)—yet the methods of science and manufacturing used to produce this technology depend upon a rigid conceptual separation of these terms even as they mix them together profoundly in their actions to create the can. A modern rhetoric, then, operates by making an appeal to a transcendent source of knowledge—“This is a matter for science to decide!”—in order to prevent the discussion from uncovering the true fuzziness of ontology. For Latour, as long as we accept this anti-rhetorical rhetoric, we stifle our own conversation about our ways of being.

Latour furthers this rhetorical analysis in “Why Has Critique Run Out of Steam?”, in which he re-assesses the project of what he terms “critique,” a mode of discourse which can be narrowly identified with post-1970’s poststructuralism or broadly identified with the modern project as a whole. The essay works from the provocative question, “What if explanations resorting automatically to power, society, discourse had outlived their usefulness and deteriorated to the point of now feeding the most gullible sort of critique?” (“Why Has” 229-30). Latour notes that the same spirit of critique associated with postmodernists like Foucault or Derrida—automatic suspicion of the truth-claims of authority, discourse, and science—have now come to be deployed by conspiracy theorists who want to doubt the existence of climate change, or that of the 9/11 terrorists. For Latour, identifying a phenomenon as socially constructed has come to be about *subtracting* reality from it, when it should have been about *adding* reality (“Why Has” 232). This means that when Latour traces the actions of a team of scientists to reveal how they construct a scientific fact, he does so not to debunk that fact’s pretense to factuality, but to add to our available data about that fact’s existence. To see social constructionism in this light would mean to forsake a binary which has, in Latour’s view, animated both the modern and the postmodern: the divide between the natural and the cultural, the “real” and the constructed. For Latour, these two categories are constantly muddling together; but for modern and postmodern thought they must be kept perpetually separate. The quintessential move of both modern and postmodern discourse, then, is to stop discussion over *how* nature and culture muddle together by making a transcendent appeal to one category: as when a postmodern critique dismisses a contested scientific fact as “merely” constructed. It is easy to see how such a method would lead to a rhetoric problem: on this reading, the purpose of modern and postmodern argument is not to perpetuate discussion, but to stop it utterly.

Latour thus argues that we must move beyond the regime of knowledge which he calls the Modern Constitution, but we must move on in a particular way. I have already suggested that postmodernism does not show the way forward—Latour dismisses it as “a symptom, not a fresh solution” due to its reliance on the same asymmetry as modernity (*WHNBM* 46). Neither is it sufficient to merely be anti-modern, both because Latour does not want to roll back the achievements of science (he is no conspiracy theorist) and because from his perspective “\[t\]he antimoderns, like the postmoderns, have accepted their adversaries’ playing field” (*WHNBM* 48). Antimoderns wish to return to some prior state before modernity and to reverse modernity’s binaries—and in so doing, they accept the asymmetry between modern and premodern, between culture and nature, which defines modernity itself. Antimodernity is thus insufficient. Instead, Latour advocates for the formation of a “nonmodern constitution,” defined as a regime of knowledge which “takes simultaneously into account the moderns’ Constitution and the populations of hybrids that that Constitution rejects and allows to proliferate” (*WHNBM* 47). A nonmodern, then, makes no attempt to reverse modern binaries like the postmodern or antimodern. Instead, the nonmodern aims to expose “the middle”—all the ways in which the binaries of modernity muddle together in various imbroglios (*WHNBM* 47).

Latour pursues the nonmodern constitution in the midst of what he calls the “crisis of the critical stance,” in which postmodern viewpoints proliferate, but none manage to escape the reductivism of modernity (*WHNBM*, 5). Listing three critical approaches, “naturalization, socialization, and deconstruction,” Latour ruthlessly demonstrates how each, in much the same manner as modernity, segregates nature from society, and both from discourse (*WHNBM*, 6). When deconstruction, for example, speaks of the ozone hole as constructed by discourse, the hole’s clouds and chemicals disappear. This is not to deny the insights of postmodernism: indeed, for Latour, all objects “are *simultaneously real, like nature, narrated, like discourse, and collective, like society*” (*WHNBM*, italics original). Postmodernism succeeds in pointing out these individual aspects of objects, but fails in reducing them to only one such aspect. In Latour’s nonmodern constitution, the first task of thought is thus not to reverse binaries but to trace the hybridity of all phenomena. Critique thus can get us only so far.

Latour notes that the same critical moves employed by postmodernists—automatic suspicion of the truth-claims of authority, discourse, and science—have now come to be deployed by conspiracy theorists. Debunking has been democratized, with the disturbing consequence that the same tools employed in, say, postcolonial critique are now used—even by Jean Baudrillard, Latour notes sadly—to deny that the Twin Towers were destroyed by terrorists and assign blame to the U.S. regime (“Why Has,” 228). Although Latour expresses no regret for the role he has played in furthering critique, he insists that the project must be refigured “in order to transform the critical urge in the ethos of someone who *adds* reality to matters of fact” (“Why Has,” 232). For Latour, postmodernity’s mistake was thus to assume that because something has been constructed and implies values—it is a “matter of concern,” to use Latour’s terminology—that it is *not therefore* also a matter of fact. In this, postmodernity merely retreads the nature/culture binary assumed by modernity: though postmodernity sorts objects differently into the categories of nature and culture (arguing that some things which modernity took to be natural are in fact cultural), it retains the conviction that the real belongs to the side of nature. Critique for Latour must thus recognize that to say that something is socially constructed is in fact to claim that it is *more real* than otherwise, breaking down the nature/culture and fact/value binaries once and for all. To make this move would be to decisively adopt a nonmodern constitution.

Given his study of scientific methodology, Latour would be the first to stress that the nonmodern constitution cannot merely be a philosophical position: it must seep into our practices and our discourse. For this, it needs rhetoric. And indeed, I would contend that Latour’s has been a rhetorical project all along. His early work *Science in Action* opens with a consideration of moving “from weaker to stronger rhetoric” (the title of the book’s first section). For Latour, “Rhetoric is a fascinating albeit despised discipline, but it becomes still more important when debates are so exacerbated that they become scientific and technical” (*Science in Action*, 30). In Latour’s early “deconstruction” of science, he dedicates himself to tracing the ways in which scientists employ rhetoric to make facts—*Science in Action* is to a large extent a rhetorical analysis of scientific communication. Yet rhetoric clearly fulfills a larger role for Latour, for as his analysis of the nature/culture split in *WHNBM* makes clear, all of our debates in the modern world have “become scientific and technical.” The rise of imbroglios tying together big questions of science, politics and religion have made rhetoric inescapable. And yet in the modern constitution we lack good ways to continue this rhetoric—indeed, the modern constitution is predicated on denying that scientific rhetoric, for example, even exists, even while employing it to shut down public discussion.

In Latour’s reading of our modern rules of discourse, science as the voice of nature provides a “reservoir of incontrovertible certainties that can be brought in to put an end to the incessant chatter of obscurantism and ignorance” (*Politics of Nature*, 12). Scientific facts thus serve the role of transcendent oracles, providing truth from on high that allow us to cease arguing about what kind of world we will have. Under the modern constitution, the continual chatter of rhetoric, negotiating how we compose our common world, is intolerable—we must therefore bring discussion to an end with an appeal to a transcendent Nature (science) or Society (politics). These tactics “short-circuit the procedures that allow us to define the common world” (*Politics of Nature*, 52). The characteristic binaries of the modern constitution thus limit rhetoric by design, not merely as a side effect. For all their warfare, Science and Politics ultimately ally in seeking to close down the perpetual discussion of the *demos* (the people of a democracy), a move which is both profoundly anti-rhetorical and deeply violent. Escaping the modern constitution would thus mean to “move from a warlike version of public life *to a civil version*” (*Politics of Nature*, 61). Rather than employing the eternal verities of Science or Society to compel one another to shut up, we could work together through rhetoric in a collective to determine what sort of world we are to live in. For Latour, a nonmodern rhetoric would thus provide a way forward into a more productive and more peaceful means of doing politics together. By helping us trace the various actors and the techniques they deploy to persuade (as in *Science in Action*), a nonmodern rhetoric keeps conversation going rather than shutting it down, grounding politics in discussion, the *demos*, rather than a silence of an authoritative fiat.

Latour has pursued his project of a nonmodern rhetoric to its fullest extent yet with his recent, major work *An Inquiry into Modes of Existence*, consisting of a book and supporting website (hereafter designated *Inquiry* for the main text, published in print and online, and *AIME* for web-specific content) which considers the role institutions play in making up modernity. Latour proposes to “add to the irreduction of beings the irreduction of ways of being,” that is, to examine how actors work together to make up the common world *(AIME,* “Glossary: Irreductions”). Latour characterizes institutions like law, religion, or science as offering different ways of being or modes of existence, modes which are often set starkly against one another. He does not deny the disparate values that these institutions promote, but rather seeks to delineate how each contributes to the composition of the common world. Despite these vital contributions, Latour believes that under the Modern Constitution these institutions give accounts of themselves which are not just lacking in truth value, but insufficient to defend the institutions themselves. *Inquiry* therefore seeks to give a better account of each institution’s values than the institution is capable of giving itself. For instance, Latour argues that “the experience of objectivity did not seem to protect Science with a capital S very well” (*Inquiry,* 11). His refiguring of the notion of objectivity is not so much that it is untrue—though it is doubtful that Latour would assent to any orthodox description of the doctrine—but that it does not serve its purpose very well, does not build up the institution of Science as it is meant to. In redescribing how the institutions work, Latour is not seeking to debunk them, but merely to give a better account of their rhetoric and practices, one not beholden to the modern constitution. He should thus be understood as *supporting* institutions by seeking to give them a rationale that will carry them beyond the modern constitution without endorsing simple antimodernism. This defense of institutions is germane to a speculative sacred rhetoric, because religion is (after all) constituted heavily by a number of institutions. I will have more to say about the religious aspects of Latour’s work in *Inquiry* as I look more specifically at his religious rhetoric; for now, it will suffice to note that his theoretical work up to the present day well supports a new approach to sacred rhetoric.

Latour’s pursuit of the nonmodern constitution, from the reconsideration of critique to a defense of institutions, thus provides a compelling basis for what I have been calling a speculative sacred rhetoric. Just as Latour’s nonmodern rhetoric aims to bring together what modernity has torn apart, what we need from a study of religious rhetoric is an approach that will gather together the various actors involved—angels, skeptics, clergy, vestments, marquee signs, evil spirits—rather than labeling them off-limits to a properly rigorous study. Latour has already helped us toward this goal with his larger project and his analysis of “the crossed-out God” (as discussed in my introduction), and turning to his work on religion can help us still further.

### A Person-giving Rhetoric

Religion thus finds a place in much of Latour’s work, from *WHNBM* to *Inquiry*. Indeed, in several of his most pivotal works on religion Latour claims to be writing a sermon—*performing* religious discourse in order to analyze it. Grasping what Latour has to offer the field will mean reading these works in light of his overall project as I sketched it above.

Latour’s first sermon is the 2001 essay “‘Thou Shalt Not Take the Lord’s Name in Vain’: Being a Sort of Sermon on the Hesitations of Religious Speech.” In this work, Latour articulates a theory of religious speech which gives us a starting place for his definition of the sermon—and thus a critical point for understanding his religious rhetoric. The essay outlines three types of speech, tied respectively to science, politics and religion: information-giving, group-bonding, and the genre he seeks to practice in sermonizing himself: “person-giving or presence-enhancing.” Whereas informative speech connects the listeners to distant, previously unknown information, and political speech performs the creation of a group, person-giving speech performs a different task altogether. This is not to say that it is the only acceptable mode. Properly understood, Latour does not condemn either of the first two modes: “Without information-carrying talks we would be stuck here and now without any way to move nor to refer, but without group-formation talks we would not know to what entity we belong” (“‘Thou Shalt,’” 215-16). As we have seen, Latour does not wish to debunk our desire to understand the world (science, information-giving) nor the power of society (politics, group-bonding). Yet as we have seen, he rejects the claim that all knowledge can be reduced to one of these two things. Similarly, in “very provisionally” attempting person-giving speech, Latour rejects the claim that all rhetoric can be reduced to science or politics (“‘Thou Shalt,’” 216). The first characteristic of a Latourian sermon, then, is the negative trait that it is neither purely informative nor purely political speech.

Yet as Latour articulates it, person-giving speech has an even stronger goal than merely evading the conventional genres of modernist rhetoric. Latour sets this challenge for himself in relating to his readers: “can I address you so as to take your attention *away* from the transportation of information and the making of identities?” (“‘Thou Shalt,’” 216). The goal of person-giving speech is thus to stop the audience thinking merely about facts or identities, that is, to redirect their thought away from the terms of the modern constitution. Latour seeks to take attention away from the transcendent categories of distant scientific information and the overarching Social and return “attention to you, here and now, as being what I call ‘persons’” (“‘Thou Shalt,’” 216). Focusing the audience on the realm of the present and the immanent thus becomes the first goal of person-giving speech. For Latour, religious truth is not transcendent, but immanent. This immanent rhetoric has two implications: an emphasis on language as material (cf. also *Politics of Nature*, 85), and an awareness of the sheer complexity of personhood (cf. “‘Thou Shalt,’” 233). Because language is such a difficult material to work with, and because personhood is so hard to grasp, religious speech must have extraordinary potency to return attention to the here and now.

The immanence of religious speech thus allows for the signature action of such speech, person-giving. By focusing the audience on the immanent, person-giving speech “generates or performs persons in presence and thereby a new assemblage of persons in presence” (“‘Thou Shalt,’” 216). At first this definition might sound indistinguishable from his definition of political speech—the difference between “group forming” and creating “a new assemblage of persons” looks superficially like a mere change in terminology. However, as Latour further describes religious speech the differences become more stark. Unlike political speech, religious speech remains concerned with a truth beyond the truth of group bonding. However, that truth is embodied—incarnated—in persons. In Latour’s conception of religious speech, “there is never any message; there are only messengers” (“‘Thou Shalt,’” 225). Each messenger repeats religious truth anew, and each renews the tradition of messengers. Rather than the simple forging of group identity as in political rhetoric, person-giving speech attempts to bring the whole self of the messenger and receiver into contact with one another. Such speech could hardly be reduced to a mere concern with a message or identity formation. It has far more to do, Latour says, with the ever repetitive yet ever crucial speech of lovers: repeating the same tired phrases over and over again, they try desperately to become more present to one another through the speech act “I love you.” Religious speech is thus centered not just in the immanence of incarnation, but in a desire for communion—an encounter with the other based on recognizing the whole person, not merely a set of facts or an identity.

Much as in his interrogation of the state of critique, Latour ends his early sermon hesitantly, in the conviction that he has “certainly failed” to create the communion that a true sermon would foster (“‘Thou Shalt,’” 234). Both modes of speech, the post-critical and the person-giving, seem to escape him. Yet I contend that this is merely a temporary stay, for *On the Modern Cult of the Factish Gods* returns to both rhetorical modes—and it does so again in the form of a sermon. In this case, Latour begins his sermon with hesitation, picking up where he had previously left off. Though he makes the bold move of confessing his own Catholic faith at the opening of the essay, he also describes to what extent the modern constitution has left him hesitant: “Religion, in my tradition, in my corner of the world, has become impossible to enunciate” (*On the Modern,* 100). Though Latour does not elaborate on this statement, he provides a footnote to his earlier sermon, suggesting that all the challenges of speaking religiously remain in place despite his first foray into that mode. It should thus be clear that the difficulty of speaking religiously here again has to do with the reign of the modern constitution, sorting discourse into the realms of scientific and political speech. As in the earlier sermon, Latour’s project again is to get outside that binary. And indeed, Latour again draws an analogy with love talk to describe his new sermon as person-giving in the lovely phrase “Love is made of syllogisms whose premises are persons” (*On the Modern*, 103). In seeking to practice this transformational, person-giving rhetoric, Latour furthers his definition of the sermon as the exemplary nonmodern speech.

His second sermon, however, does not merely repeat the project he had attempted some years earlier, but enters into its method more fully. It is no longer a “sort of sermon,” but a full-blown mimicry of the sermonic genre in written form: “my purpose is not to talk *about* religion, but to talk to you *religiously*, at least religiously enough so that we can begin to analyze the conditions of felicity of such a speech-act, by demonstrating it *in vivo*” (*On the Modern*, 101). In order to analyze religious speech, Latour contends, it is necessary to speak religiously. If we are to understand the actual functions of a religious speech act, then, we must get closer to the speech rather than distancing ourselves like critics. As soon as we pull back, withhold assent, grow skeptical, the phenomenon we are trying to analyze vanishes: the *experience* generated by religious speech. We have left the realm of presence and abandoned the “immediacy of assent” that Latour, citing Whitehead, claims religion requires (“‘Thou Shalt,’” 228). The purpose of Latour’s initial confession thus becomes clear. In order to speak of religion, he must speak from within his own religion. The form of a sermon thus provides Latour a mode which enables the simultaneous performance and analysis of religious speech as critique cannot.

The confession of religious speech produces another rhetorical effect crucial to Latour’s project: a new sense of time. In his second sermon, Latour furthers the emphasis on presence taken up in his first sermon by asserting that religious speech does not just emphasize the here and now, it actually changes one’s experience of that present. In love talk or religious talk, “[w]e are not undergoing one experience among others, but a change in the pulse and tempo of experience: *kairos* is the word the Greeks would have used to designate this new sense of urgency” (*On the Modern*, 102). Because religious speech is all about the present, it can produce an experience which changes our sense of time—unlike scientific or political speech. By re-presenting the religious experience to believers, the sermon aligns them anew with the narrative of their faith, filling them “with the gift of renewed presence” (*On the Modern*, 107). This is not to say that religious speech removes the audience from the here and now to plant them in religious history—rather, it revives the history anew *in their persons.* In the terms of the modern constitution, this is merely to tell old stories from a past long-dead, for the modern conception of time is that of a line of “epistemic ruptures so radical that nothing of that past survives in them” (*WHNBM*, 68). For the modern constitution, the past has been done away with by the technological progress of history. Yet for the Christian and Jewish religions, time is constructed “around Presence (that is, the presence of God), and not around the emergence of the vacuum, or DNA, or microchips, or automated factories” (*WHNBM*, 71). Religious rhetoric is thus able to make the tradition of the religion alive and present again for the audience. This is a *kairos* which is fully present, not relying upon chains of reference to distant facts as in scientific rhetoric (though not denying them either), and also disruptive of a linear sense of time. Latour’s sermon thus produces a certain kind of experience: the audience is grounded ever more fully in their present moment, and yet in that very grounding they are jarred out of the conventional forward-looking regime of time.

Latour ends his second sermon much as his first, in hesitation and the fear of failure. Yet if he cannot be sure that he has occasioned communion, in beginning with confession and taking on the oral form of a speech he has at least gestured toward the person-giving of religious speech. And despite the hesitations of his conclusion, it is worth noting that his final words might be read as a kind of back-door altar call, an invitation for the audience to join him in his proclamation of faith: “Why would anyone claim to speak religion if it is not in order to save me, to convert me, on the spot?” (*On the Modern*, 123). Here Latour expresses a desire to lead his audience to some kind of experience, one that will shake us out of the critical and debunking attitude of modernity. The note of emotion in his conclusion returns us to the person-giving aspect of his rhetoric: we are being confronted in some way with Bruno Latour the person. Though Latour may disparage his attempts at person-giving rhetoric, then, it is clear that in some sense his sermons show him practicing what he preaches.

This emphasis on immanence carries through to what I will term Latour’s third sermon, the recently translated *Rejoicing, or, the Torments of Religious Speech,* in which Latour continues his confessional approach, though he does not claim to preach. His consideration of language in this, his most extended consideration of religion, might be surprising since Latour is perhaps most significant in contemporary critical theory for *resisting* the linguistic turn. For example, in his article “‘Where Are the Missing Masses? The Sociology of a Few Mundane Artifacts,’” Latour makes the case for turning “our exclusive attention away from humans and look also at nonhumans” (153). For Latour, the construction of human knowledge regimes owes as much to nonhuman objects as it does to humans and our linguistic work. Accordingly, he is best known for stressing non-linguistic actors such as institutions, bodies, and actions; however, simply because he advocates for considering nonhuman factors does not mean Latour is opposed to considering human factors as well. Simply because he has offered a necessary, material corrective to the linguistic tendencies of current thought, we need not grow suspicious when he turns his attention to language. After all, as Latour himself would admit, just because we should acknowledge that culture is made of up of *more than* language does not mean that language does not contribute to its constitution.

Latour therefore seeks in *Rejoicing* to shake up the usual way we moderns think of speech by pointing out how differently religious speech works. In doing so, he provides a notion of religious language purged of an exclusive focus on order and transcendence, making us able to talk about religious language again. We moderns think of language as referring to things, providing access to knowledge, through what Latour calls “double-click communication,” the linking of referent to reference through a chain of signs (*Rejoicing,* 21). In contrast, for Latour religious speech has as its goal “not to map out references but . . . to produce something else entirely: the near and the far, closeness or distance” (*Rejoicing,* 26). Religious speech, in Latour’s conception, does not help us “accede to the distant in order to control information about the world”; rather, its “sole characteristic is to constitute those it is addressed to as being close and saved” (*Rejoicing,* 118). He again repeats his example of a conversation between lovers: if asked “Do you love me?”, a lover would hardly respond with “‘Yes, but you already know that, I told you so last year’” (*Rejoicing,* 25). Like love-talk, then, religious speech does not aim to connect us to a referent, a truth, but to draw persons near to one another.

This emphasis on closeness and distance permits us to escape the modern reduction of religion to transcendence and order. For Latour, religion is not defined by its reference to the distant beings of transcendence or an abstract order: on the contrary, “religion leads nowhere” (*Rejoicing,* 33). Religion is not about attaining to “a bit of transcendence”; instead, it aims to transform us in the here and now (*Rejoicing,* 33). Religion “offers something better than information transfers: it transforms the absent into the present, the dead into the risen” (Rejoicing, 123). Latour thus stresses the communal and intimate aspects of religion, the way in which religion seeks to transform lives, not just to inculcate beliefs. Understanding religious rhetoric in this way, as “conversion speech” rather than the transcendently and factually oriented language of theology (*Rejoicing,* 40), makes more sense of religion as a social and material phenomenon, and gives us a method to understand the rhetorical ways in which religions construct themselves. Latour’s perspective has much in common with the Burke of *PC*, with his stress on the relational notion of orientation, rather than *RR*’s stress on the transcendent intellectual systems of logology. Person-giving, with its understanding of sacred rhetoric as dependent upon the horizontal bonds between persons, aligns more readily with Burke’s understanding of the immanent workings of orientation than the stress upon transcendence in *RR.* In essence, rather than examining how transcendence and order structure religious rhetoric, we should look at how religious language and other rhetorical tools are structured by the constant working-out of transformation and presence. For Latour, it would seem, the hoary evangelical Christian cliché that Christianity “is not about a religion; it’s about a relationship” may be more true than it seems.

Latour continues this approach in *Inquiry,* continuing to analogize between love-talk and religion and denying the importance of transcendence. He insists, as he has in other work, that Science is about the distant or transcendent while religion is about the immanent: “it is when we speak of Science that we should raise our eyes toward the heavens and when we speak of Religion that we should lower them toward the Earth” (322). Latour insists that looking to the supernatural prevents us from seeing “the *here and now* of presence,” arguing that religion must always be attentive to the present time rather than eternal timelessness, to present bodies rather than distant spirits. Within the institutional framework of *Inquiry,* Religion appears as the mode attuned to the immanent, the present and the close up, while Science concerns itself with the transcendent, that which is remote in time and space.

At the same time, in *Inquiry* Latour productively complicates his discussion of transcendence and immanence. He introduces the term “hiatus” to articulate how each mode of existence employs human thought to overcome the discontinuities between different aspects of action, world, and being. Latour sees “the idea of a fundamental continuity of phenomena from which the human mind introduces discontinuities” as a key distortion of Western thought *(AIME,* “Glossary: Hiatus,” 3). In contrast, *Inquiry* holds that phenomena are already discontinuous, and the modes exist to smooth out those discontinuities by making connections and gathering together different actors to compose the common world. So Science brings together our perceptions and those things which “transcend” or evade them such as molecules or currents of energy by the means of technical equipment and specialized skills. The continuity between mind and world is therefore *created* by the mode. Accordingly, Latour does not banish transcendence from his lexicon, but insists on a distinction between good transcendence and bad transcendence. Good transcendence “seeks to focus attention on the hiatus, the discontinuity, the step, the threshold by which all existents must pass in order to subsist,” that is, it recognizes that every actor is other to every other actor *(AIME,* “Glossary: Transcendence,” 1). Every object, as Graham Harman would put it, withdraws, has its own hidden depths that no other object can fully exhaust, and so each object transcends its relations with others (see Harman 44). Good transcendence is multiple and variable because it inheres in every being and is therefore “strictly synonymous with immanence” *(AIME,* “Glossary: Transcendence,” 1). For Latour, immanent beings possess transcendence because they always to some extent withdraw from relations with others. Latour sees the opposition of transcendence and immanence as a category mistake, an intellectual construct opposing two terms which ought to be intertwined.

In contrast, bad transcendence seeks to bring an end to action and inquiry through an appeal to “the hereafter / beyond (God, Revolution, the State, the Market etc) or of the beforehand / prior (the subject, the symbolic etc)” *(AIME,* “Glossary: Transcendence,” 3). Latour dedicates more attention to good transcendence than bad in *Inquiry,* perhaps out of a desire to correct perceptions that he is opposed to transcendence entirely. Much like his discussion of transcendence in *Politics of Nature* as the attempt to abrogate the construction of the common world, Latour opposes transcendence only when it is deployed as bring an end to discussion (*Politics of Nature,* 52). He does not oppose the idea of transcendence as such—transcendence as the encounter with the radically other—but to its deployment as an absolute apodeictic meant to bring discussion to a halt, as for example when someone attempts to conclude an argument by marshaling the *topos,* “Science says” (or, in perhaps the anti-modern equivalent of the phrase, “God says”). Considering religious transcendence from this point of view, certainly we would have to acknowledge that some religious rhetorics deploy transcendence in this manner, placing the transcendent and the immanent in unhelpful opposition. Yet Latour’s work on religion demonstrates that it is possible for a religious thinker—Latour himself—to productively complicate this discussion.

Considering Latour’s three sermons and *Inquiry* thus shows that Latour’s rhetorical theory and practice both thus point us away from the methods of communication favored by the modern constitution. Modern rhetoric emphasizes a chain of references which connect us to distant objects, or else a distant goal which unites us in a group; in contrast, the nonmodern rhetoric of the sermon emphasizes the very intimate practices of communion and kairos. As Latour puts it, analogizing again with love talk, “what happens to you, would you say, when you are addressed by love-talk? Very simply put: you were *far away*, and now you are *closer*” (*On the Modern*, 103). The sermon acts to create nearness rather than distance. It models good transcendence, a notion which acknowledges the other without reinforcing a notion that transcendence necessarily closes down discussion. (Bringing the other nearer may, in fact, produce more debate.) It may thus provide a way forward amidst the decay of critique. For if critique distanced us from other actors (persons and things), religious speech provides a mode which lets us get closer.

Latour’s person-giving rhetoric, then, offers another resource for rhetoricians seeking conceptual tools to make sense of religious rhetoric. Much like Burke’s notions of orientation and conversion, Latour’s person-giving rhetoric supports a speculative sacred rhetoric by providing an account of what happens in religious rhetoric not drawn from other rhetorical domains (the political, the social) but from religion itself.

### Person-giving and Transcendence

Although Latour’s work seems to align readily with the pursuit of a speculative sacred rhetoric, Marc C. Santos argues that despite Latour’s reconsideration of modernity’s “crossed-out God,” Latour himself never really succeeds in uncrossing the deity. For Santos, overcoming the modern constitution requires not just an ontological shift, but an ethical one, “transforming critique into care” (315). He fully embraces Latour’s goals of reinvigorating the modes of existence and going beyond critique to composition, but does not view Latour’s account of how to reach those goals as sufficient. Drawing on the work of Emmanuel Levinas, Santos argues that “Transforming critique into care is not a matter of merely reframing *how* we develop knowledge or reconsidering *what* knowledge is; flattening ontology will not necessarily inspire the humanist, scientist, economist, or politician to embrace Latour’s ‘messy’ onto-political project” (315). Latour’s project, on this account, has remained primarily focused on ontology, yet for Santos ontology alone cannot inspire actors to compose the common world differently; for that, we need care, and (for Levinas and Santos) thus we need a more productive notion of transcendence.

Santos acknowledges that Latour endorses “horizontal transcendence,” he sees this immanentized style of transcendence as insufficient to foster care (325). For Latour, transcendence as set apart from immanence “is a dance partner to the critical attitude” (315); even the transcendence of God must therefore be submitted to the multiple transcendences of a flat ontology.[^28] In contrast, for Levinas, transcendence does not short-circuit discussion in the pursuit of certainty, then, but instead unsettles one’s self-centered confidence and assurance. Accordingly, Santos views Latour’s version of transcendence as insufficient to sustain ethics: “While for Latour, the distant impedes our ability to make decisions, for Levinas, it is the indifferent rumbling of the distant that unsettles us, obligating us to make decisions that care about others in the first place. Put plainly, transcendence need not send us far away, but can inspire us to traverse the recursive loop that keeps us caring about the faces closest to us” (331). For Levinas and Santos, the transcendence of God is not just the flattened transcendence of Latour’s ontology but a single, primary transcendence beyond the reach of being, which cannot be thought of as anything but other. This radical transcendence inspires care because it can be claimed by no one: we cannot repay our debt to it, we cannot claim a special relationship with it. Accordingly, it always returns us to the face of the other before us as the only way to respond to its claims. A sense of the other’s transcendence is thus a necessity in developing responsibility. For Santos, then, Latour’s project fails to uncross God or, by extension, the other, and thus fails to move fully beyond a critical stance.

Though Santos frames his argument in terms of Levinasian ethics, one need not assent to elevating Levinas over Latour to assent to it, at least in part. Santos dissents from Latour on prescriptive grounds—the argument between them amounts to a disagreement within a systematic theory of religion, concerned with the construction of a future theory of religion. My approach in this dissertation, however, is historical, and Santos’s critique might in fact be most operative from that perspective. For it is clear that considered historically, the transcendent cannot be removed from religion—religious systems and thinkers everywhere refer to God and the spiritual realm. Though we ought to carefully examine whether our understanding of these transcendent concepts has been twisted by the modern constitution—perhaps historical figures are closer to Latour’s understanding of the transcendent than we might think—we cannot banish talk of the transcendent from analysis of historic religion without risking a reinterpretation of their work in our own image. Accordingly, a reading of Latour somewhat chastened by an encounter with Santos makes for the most productive means of proceeding toward a history of sacred rhetoric.

Latour’s purely immanent approach to religion could operate within what Brian Jackson calls the “inclusive” approach to defining religion, in which “all kinds of human symbolic behavior can be considered religious, even rhetoric that rejects what is commonly understood as religious belief or behavior” (18). A perspective which interprets human behavior of various types (political, cultural) as manifesting structures like a religion could fit neatly with Latour. Indeed, Latour’s own example of love talk is in some ways this type of analysis, identifying a religious structure within a relationship between two people, and vice versa. However, it is not clear that a purely immanent notion of person-giving provides as useful a tool if we take Jackson’s “supernatural” approach, which is “concerned with (for lack of a better phrase) that-which-is-beyond-human-and-nature” (23). Jackson draws on Charles Taylor to make the case that whatever one’s position on the ontology of divine beings, it is undeniable that religious rhetoric frequently if not always operates rhetorically *as if* a transcendent being or beings existed. Accordingly, a properly irreductive and speculative rhetoric ought not enjoin such rhetoric to forget about transcendence, but should rather seek a rhetorical framework for approaching that transcendence. Clay Spinuzzi’s review of *Rejoicing* speaks to this claim:

In Latour’s other work, he *describes* how people practice science, technology, law, politics, and so forth. He watches people, follows the transformations, and compares those to the stories that people tell about what they did. This careful descriptive work underpins the theoretical explanations that he provides.

But in *Rejoicing,* he *prescribes* how people should practice religion. He describes sacred texts to some extent, but according to his narrative, religion has been captured by Double-Click Communication. Its practice is wrong—according to Latour. From where does he get his description, and how is it authoritative? Can he do something similar to what he did in *Laboratory Life,* following the practice of renewal and then examining how the religious describe it in contrasting terms? Perhaps—but he doesn’t. Does *Rejoicing* tell us something new about the practice of religion—or does it just tell us the liturgy that Latour recommends?

Spinuzzi’s complaint amounts to noting that Latour’s understanding of religion lacks the anthropological focus he has insisted on as the founder of Actor-Network Theory, or ANT. And indeed, despite Latour’s background in the study of religion (see Schmidgen 13), the contrast between his work on science, which is grounded in his fieldwork in laboratories, and his work on religion is notable. Though *Inquiry* ostensibly takes up the institutional workings of the phenomena it considers, in fact in that work Latour manifests little interest in the workings of actual religious institutions—for instance, the College of Cardinals, or simply the communal life of a local church. If, as Santos argues, Latour fails to fully account for the positive value of transcendence as respect for the other, perhaps this lack of ANT-ish attention to religion itself has something to do with it. Christopher Watkin has argued in a review of *Rejoicing* that “Latour relies on a strict dichotomy between information and transformation that pushes him into the rather awkward position of having to argue that there is no discernible message (information, news) in Christianity whatsoever” (n.p.). Watkin rightly notes that Latour’s interest in immanence and the transformational work of religious language is such that he utterly denies the importance of religious content—a position inconsistent with his own irreductive principles. A more fully Latourian sacred rhetoric, then, would need to return its attention to the content of religion itself.

As I have argued, I would not go so far as Spinuzzi in suggesting that Latour’s religious thought only gives us Latour’s religious views—I have already argued that the concept of “person-giving” has value for rhetorical studies, and (like Santos) fully endorsed Latour’s attempt to move us away from the modern constitution. I would tend to agree with Steven Mailloux, who like Watkin argues that “Latour’s stark contrast between networks of referential information and processions of dynamic translations is invigoratingly useful but perhaps somewhat overstated” (426). Latour’s thought is foundational, and the critique of that work implied here must be understood in light of a constructive attempt to further his project. Moreover, in light of Burke’s dominance over the field, there is a case to be made (as I argued in the previous chapter) that rhetoric’s understanding of religion has been unhelpfully dominated by a transcendent approach that sees theologies and intellectual systems as more important to the rhetorical operations of religion than any other factor. For that reason, we can see Latour’s person-giving rhetoric as a necessary polemical rejoinder to the state of the field, an invigorating if overstated correction to our excessive focus on a damaging type of transcendence. At the same time, Latour’s discomfort with the content of religion and its institutions and teachings means he does not fully escape this dominance of language and ideas over religious rhetoric. In an ironic twist, in order to better represent the materiality of religion—its lived reality for adherents and systems—we need to add transcendence back to person-giving rhetoric. Only by doing so, by following the actors whose ethics are inspired by transcendence, can we follow Latour’s own anthropological principles.

Fortunately, religion itself offers us such a dual perspective on transcendence and immanence with the idea of *incarnation.* James K. A. Smith puts the need for incarnation well when he argues that, from a phenomenological perspective informed by Derrida and Marion, “it seems that we either reduce the transcendent to conceptual language, or we give up the possibility of speaking altogether. It seems our choice is either metaphysics or silence” (*Speech and Theology,* 44). Smith echoes Santos’s concern about immanence in pointing out that language, perception, the sign, and the concept tend to *reduce* the other to only that which is immanent. Yet that which the sign points to—God, another person—inevitably exceeds or transcends the immanence we are able to grasp. Though such invocation of transcendence would doubtless make Latour uncomfortable, Smith argues for a way of retrieving it drawn from Augustine:

> [T]he sign, as incarnational, is able to refer to transcendence in a fundamentally *non-violent* manner. For Levinas and Marion, the problem with phenomenological conceptualization is that it reduces the other to the same; it effects a violation of the other, a fundamental *violence*: it reduces transcendence to immanence. By thinking of signs as instances of incarnation, Augustine is able to understand language *not* as essentially violent, but rather as that which grants access to things, but at the same time leaves them in their transcendence. (*Speech and Theology,* 127)

For Smith, as for Santos, a purely immanent religion risks violently reducing the other to that which is present to us. Such a model of religion demands that the other submit to what we can grasp, that it consist of nothing but the things we can access. Without some room for transcendence, for that which exceeds our grasp, our religion is solipsistic and fundamentally violent. Yet a religion of pure transcendence would do its own violence to the immanent unless it “gives up any possibility of non-violent description and thereby gives up theory” (*Speech and Theology,* 6). Here Smith echoes Latour’s concern about transcendence as a means of *imposing* meaning or truth upon a community, and follows Latour in rejecting this religion of enlightened certainty.

Rather than tumbling into the pitfalls of either a totally immanent or totally transcendent religion, Smith proposes incarnation as a model for how transcendence can appear in immanence. He explicates this traditional Christian doctrine as a way of understanding a non-violent language, yet the argument is equally applicable to religion itself:

The Incarnation is precisely an immanent sign *of* transcendence—God appearing in the flesh. Thus it is a structure of both presence and absence: present in the flesh, and yet referring beyond, the Incarnation—as the *signum exemplum*—retains the structural incompleteness of the sign which is constitutive of language, for to constitute the God-man as only man is to idolize the body, failing to constitute it as a manifestation of the divine. Divinity, while it cannot be reduced to this body, is nevertheless infleshed in it and thus signaling beyond itself. This is why the God-man is a *mediator* between divinity and humanity, finitude and the Infinite. (*Speech and Theology,* 123)

On Smith’s model, the fundamental absence or transcendence of the other is neither abrogated nor overcome—God remains wholly other from oneself, as Santos or Levinas would insist upon. Yet the incarnate sign *points to*—thus aiming to draw us closer to—the other, retaining the immanence of Latour’s person-giving. Neither transcendence nor immanence is here invoked to dismiss or short-circuit the other, but rather both work together to unite finite perception and infinite alterity.

If Latour’s person-giving or presence-enhancing rhetoric is insufficient, as Santos suggests, the solution is not to toss aside its real insights, but rather to seek a fuller theorization of Latour’s language. Latour’s sacred rhetoric offers us a compelling account of religious immanence, and its terminology leaves it open for retrieval along the lines of Smith’s analysis. Though Latour can at times seem utterly dismissive of conventionally understood transcendence, his early use of the language of person-giving offers us an avenue for such retrieval.

Latour seems to think of a person as being wholly present (in opposition to the absence of scientific facts or the crossed-out God); hence his use of “person-giving” and “presence-enhancing” as synonymous terms. Yet a person is much better thought of as Smith’s “structure of both presence and absence.” It is not just violent to think of a person as wholly present, it is inconsistent with our most basic experiences—even the people we have known the longest surprise us, show themselves (however directly or indirectly) to have qualities we have never experienced. If even a ball of cotton ultimately withdraws from the flame that consumes it, as Graham Harman argues, how much more do persons withdraw from the others that seek to understand them (44)? “Person-giving” thus ought not to signal total presence and immanence, but an incarnational structure as Smith describes. By properly “discounting”[^29] Latour’s polemical statements about transcendence, we can arrive at this richer understanding of his sacred rhetoric.

### Person-giving, Testimony, and the Medieval Sermon

Furthering Latour’s person-giving rhetoric means not only amending his theorization of religious rhetoric, but examining where it might show up in other rhetorical work. To do so will begin to move us toward a counter-history of religious rhetoric. Accordingly, the remainder of this chapter will propose a starting place for uncovering additional instances of person-giving, incarnational rhetoric. That starting places lies in the Middle Ages.

The Middle Ages have been for many years the backwater of rhetorical history, visited by few scholars in either monograph, article, or anthology. Save for a few determined local boosters like James J. Murphy, Rita Copeland, and Martin Camargo, the field of medieval rhetoric can look like a ghost town. Yet this is precisely why it is ripe for rehabilitation for a speculative sacred rhetoric. Medieval rhetoric is the great other of the Western rhetorical tradition (nonwestern rhetorics being perhaps the only traditions that exceed it in marginalization): it is spurned for being neither as originary as the classical period nor as innovative as the early modern and subsequent periods. Often treated as purely derivative or unoriginal by rhetorical histories still indebted to modern notions of the solitary, Copernican genius, the Middle Ages may seem an unpromising place of departure. Yet if we turn particularly to one of its most distinctive and pervasive rhetorical forms—the sermon—we can discover further examples of the person-giving speech which can enable us to speak as if we are nonmodern. Precisely because of the scorn it engenders within the modern constitution, medieval rhetoric offers an invaluable form of nonmodern rhetoric. By stepping outside the thought of modernity and its idealized past in the classical period to grapple with the medieval, we can uncover invaluable sources for a new history of sacred rhetoric.

In fact, the Latourian sermon and the medieval sermon share many characteristics. Like my discounted Latour, medieval theorists of the sermon take language to be incarnational; like him, they see rhetoric as an occasion of communion; and like his sermons, their work is highly kairotic. In particular, these tendencies can be seen what Murphy terms the *artes praedicandi,* arts of preaching: medieval handbooks covering how to deliver a sermon, drawing on rhetorical and theological sources (see Murphy 269). Numerous *artes praedicandi* from the Middle Ages survive, and taken together they offer a distinct tradition of rhetorical and sacred reflections. Many excellent studies of medieval preaching theory exist, yet these works deserve to be brought into conversation with larger theoretical conversations about nonmodern and sacred rhetoric.[^30] I will therefore take up two key texts from the tradition to show how they can contribute to our understanding of the Latourian, nonmodern sermon. Augustine of Hippo’s *De doctrina christiana* (hereafter *DDC*), completed c. 426, stands at the head of the Christian preaching tradition as arguably its most influential source after the Bible. Though it has been examined carefully within rhetorical studies[^31], as has Augustine’s other work (note Burke’s treatment of his *Confessions* in *RR*), it still has much to offer us in conversation with Latour. On the other end of the Middle Ages, Ranulph Higden’s *Ars componendi sermones* (c. 1346), has received less scholarly attention, but is especially worth noting as a text that ably synthesizes much of the tradition while drawing extensively on Augustine. By analyzing these two *artes praedicandi* from the opposite ends of the medieval preaching tradition, I will thus demonstrate the value of this tradition to the discounted Latourian perspective outlined above.

The most strikingly Latourian aspect of Augustine’s and Higden’s rhetorics is their emphasis on communion—the person-to-person relationship fostered by preaching. For Murphy, this community-oriented rhetoric is a distinctive of the Christian tradition inherited from Jewish models, and thus represents an innovation on Greek and Roman rhetorical theory. He argues that Jewish and Christian exegetical methodologies “were for the sake of the community, not merely for the scholarly isolate . . . This purposeful corporate rhetoricality is not found in any other community of the ancient world” (273). Though Murphy may overstate his claim somewhat, the centrality of Scripture as a publicly read and interpreted text does distinguish Jewish and Christian rhetorics from Greek and Roman, which do not possess such a text. Jewish and Christian interpretive practices, which form an integral part of medieval rhetoric, begin to move that rhetoric toward something like Latour’s person-giving by way of community interpretation of Scripture.

And indeed, in *DDC* we find much of the treatise given over to interpretation, which must be governed by the law of love. As Augustine puts it: “So anyone who thinks he has understood the divine scriptures or any part of them, but cannot by his understanding build up this double love of God and neighbour, has not yet succeeded in understanding them” (I.40.86, p. 49). Preaching thus flows out of interpretation of Scripture, a communal activity which emphasizes building up love between adherents and God. This love is neither mere knowledge of the Scripture nor simple group bonding, but a complex ethical and affective stance. For Augustine, it first and foremost involves the enjoyment of God and use of other things in service of that enjoyment: love is thus a kind of orientation of the whole of one’s life. Augustine’s rhetor must therefore refrain from attempts to show off his own knowledge, manipulate the audience, or merely create group bonding without a spirit of love that builds up the community in the image of Christ, the incarnate person in whom all Christians participate as one body. For Murphy, Augustine’s concept of love “is in some ways a more sophisticated concept than that of Aristotle’s *ethos*, because it involves the innate humanity of both speaker and listener” (291). Augustine’s notion of love does not merely encompass provoking the audience to love the speaker—it is reciprocal, as the speaker must act in love for his audience as well. The loving rhetorical act is thus deeply reciprocal for Augustine; hence Murphy’s assessment of it as more sophisticated than a rhetoric characterized by Aristotelian *ethos.*

*DDC* is the only major early treatise on preaching, and it is widely cited by later works on the subject. Medieval preaching can thus be said to be founded upon Augustine’s love-driven rhetorical ethic. Higden manifests the influence of *DDC*, like many other *artes praedicandi,* even to the point of openly citing the earlier work, which medieval convention would not necessarily require him to do: he references *DDC* at several points including on the usefulness of nonbiblical stories (36), appropriate manner (37), the need for prayer (48), and interpretation of Scripture (50). Higden thus cites and adopts Augustine’s hermeneutics and rhetoric of love, following his teachings on the centrality of love to interpretation as well as the rhetorical act. However, his treatise emphasizes a slightly different person-giving aspect of preaching: whereas Augustine focuses on invention (giving three of the four books of *DDC* largely over to interpretive concerns), Higden stresses delivery. Two early chapters of his *Ars* discuss the preacher’s ethical stature and his care for the audience. Chapter three, “About Holiness of Behavior,” quotes Gregory the Great to the effect that “a preacher, like a rooster, should make himself heard more by what he does than by the way he sounds” (36). In Higden’s treatise, the rhetorical efficacy of the preacher derives from the entirety of his life rather than a passing *ethos* created for political purposes, one adopted merely for a single rhetorical event that can later be discarded if its effectiveness is lost. The preacher’s entire life, in and out of the pulpit, must support his message. Though Higden in fact cites Aristotle in this book, it is the *Ethics* rather than the *Rhetoric*, and it is clear that he has broadened the understanding of *ethos* originally formulated by the philosopher to extend beyond the rhetorical act to the whole of the preacher’s life.

Higden builds on this person-giving aspect of his rhetoric even more in the subsequent chapter five, “About Appropriate Care in Speaking.” Here the emphasis is on the persons of the audience: “appropriate care in speaking requires that one form one’s sermon according to the capacity of one’s listeners” (37). Following Gregory the Great, Higden stresses that the preacher must adapt his sermon to the particular needs of his audience. He points out that different audience members will be “struggling with a variety of vices or . . . in diverse situations” (38), acknowledging that it is challenging to preach to a diverse audience who may have quite different spiritual needs. The preacher must thus be careful to correct vices in one member of the audience in such a way that he does not encourage other vices. Furthermore, Higden cautions the preacher to speak with attention to the listeners’ level of education (39). Following the example of Christ, who spoke to the crowds in one style and separately to his disciples (Higden cites Luke 8:10), the preacher should be careful not to push his audience beyond their capacity with difficult matters. Higden thus shows his rhetorical theory to be highly attuned to the complex persons of the audience. In order to achieve the transformation of persons dictated by the preaching genre, he insists upon attention to the particular needs of individuals. Transformation is not achieved through mere group bonding or information transfer, but through achieving a change in each individual with his or her particular background and needs, in a relationship with a preacher who knows those needs and shapes his message accordingly.

Here we can see Higden’s continuity with Augustine, for whom both speaker and audience possess agency to make up the persuasive act (see Murphy 289). Higden’s rhetoric seeks to bring the ethical person of the preacher into contact with the diverse persons of the audience through the interpretation of Scripture. In this, it seeks to create a transformative experience rather than an instance of informative or group-bonding speech, and can thus be understood as person-giving.

Medieval preaching has a further person-giving and incarnational characteristic in its emphasis on *kairos*. Like Latour’s nonmodern rhetoric, both Augustine and Higden emphasize the present, seeking to give their audience an experience in the moment rather than pointing them away to distant facts or futures. This tendency is clearest in Higden, who emphasizes the occasional in his rhetoric, listing “relevance” as one of the three necessities for a sermon, along with “correctness of division, and usefulness of development” (34). Chapter seven, “Let the Theme Related to the Proposed Subject Matter,” outlines three different types of sermons “according to the occasion on which they are preached: the Sunday sermon, the feast-day sermon, and the sermon for different circumstances of people or for diverse affairs like visitations, elections, synods, and processions” (40). His essential genres of preaching thus include the regular weekly sermon (which itself would be highly specific to that week’s lectionary texts and the time of year) in addition to sermons specifically adapted to a festive and symbolic occasion such as the feast of Corpus Christi, Easter, Christmas, or the visit of a bishop. For Higden, a sermon is thus not merely a generic moral message, or even a piece of rhetoric tied to a generic rhetorical situation, but a work highly tailored to a specific point in time, if one that takes place within the repeating cycle of the Christian liturgical calendar and the activities of the church. Higden’s approach to *kairos* is thus both repetitive and occasional; in this, it stresses experience, both by accounting for the specific audience and in mirroring the narrative of the Bible throughout the Christian year. By preaching an Advent sermon, for example, the preacher seeks to re-create for his audience the experience of the creation waiting for Christ’s arrival. Such repetitive yet experiential situations are critical to Christian worship, and deliberately built into the liturgical life of the church. Even the repetitive aspects of medieval preaching should thus be considered highly experiential in their kairotic repetition of the foundational stories of Scripture.

Rather than seeking to give worshippers a new experience time and time again, the liturgy—of which Augustine’s or Higden’s preaching forms a part—returns them again and again to the experience of the Christian story drawn from the Bible. For Christians, this constant return to the narrative of the Gospels in the liturgy grounds their religious life, spurring ethical imitation of Christ and affective desire for his coming. By Higden’s time, this ritual rhetoric was highly refined, and his understanding of preaching clearly takes it into account. The Christian church of Augustine’s time had a much less developed set of liturgical resources (though it was not without a sophisticated liturgical rhetoric of its own; see my treatment of the early liturgical text the *Didache* in chapter five): for instance, the church of Augustine’s time had set texts for major feasts such as Easter, but not for every ordinary Sunday (see Doyle O.S.B. 14). Accordingly, his theory of preaching places less emphasis upon the preacher’s role within the ritual system. Nonetheless, Augustine’s preaching itself manifests an awareness of the preacher’s liturgical role: as the editor of his *Essential Sermons,* Daniel Doyle O.S.B. points outs, Augustine’s sermons were linked to the day’s text, and they frequently conclude with the words “Let us turn toward the Lord (*Conversi ad dominum*),” which likely indicated a ritual gesture on the part of the congregation, perhaps a turn toward the altar (Doyle O.S.B. 15). Thus, even the less liturgically developed church of Augustine’s time embedded his preaching in the kairotic and embodied structure of ritual.

This consideration of the Christian calendar and the liturgy leads me to my final point about the Latourian resonances of medieval preaching: its attempt to recreate the experience of Scripture for its audience. For Latour, the essence of religious speech is repetition in the presence of the messenger: the goal of religious speech is “to represent the presence of that which is called, in a certain technical and ritual idiom, the ‘Word incarnate,’ which is to *say* again that it is here—alive—and not dead over there, far away. It does not try to designate something, but to speak from a new state that it generates by its ways of talking” (*On the Modern*, 110). Religious speech thus attempts to incarnate, to re-awaken, the experience of the Scriptures in the faithful. I have already pointed to some of the ways in which Augustine and Higden attempt such a task, by making the preacher and audience present to one another and by emphasizing a certain kind of *kairos*. But perhaps their most important move in such an experience is the simplest: as Higden baldly puts it, “It is right and indeed necessary on every occasion to select a theme from the Bible” (41). Augustine, just as radically, does not even bother to discuss other figures or rhetorical source-material. As we have seen, Augustine and Higden emphasize experiential and person-giving rhetoric—when this approach is employed with the texts of Scripture, the desired goal is to set the audience within the narrative of the holy book, to “utter again a Word that . . . impregnates with the gift of renewed presence” (Latour, *On the Modern*, 107). The word of testimony, derived from the Scriptures and pointing to Christ, in medieval preaching aims to kindle just that renewal.

Still, despite the profound immanence of Augustine’s and Higden’s rhetorical methods, neither banishes transcendence. The love that Augustine insists upon is not just the love of neighbor, but the love of God—and he dedicates an extended portion of *DDC* to articulating how Christians ought to set their love for neighbors within the larger goal of enjoying God himself. The first book of *DDC* opens with an extended consideration of things to be enjoyed (*frui*), that is loved “for its own sake,” I.8, p. 15), and things to be used (*uti*), that is loved, not for its own sake, but because it points to those things which are enjoyed. Things to be used, in short, ought always only to be loved for how they point to things that are to be enjoyed. For Augustine, “only the eternal and unchangeable things . . . are to be enjoyed” (I.39, p. 29). God alone, for Augustine, falls in the category of things that are to be enjoyed, *frui.* This does not mean that human and other immanent “things” are not important—far from it. Augustine fully defends the Christian imperative to love one’s neighbor and even oneself (see I.42, p. 310), but insists that such love only finds its proper end insofar as it is related to God. To love a human being for that person’s own sake is to put one’s hope in a being that will ultimately fail (I.40, p. 31). Loving a person for God’s sake, though, means to “direct that neighbor to the object of his blessedness,” as Helmut David Baer paraphrases Augustine, and thus one’s love for that person takes it proper place in the divine economy (Baer 57). “Using” another person, in Augustine’s terms, thus means not turning that person to one’s own ends, but rather directing that person—and one’s own love of that person—to the ultimate end of both in God. Our relations with human beings and other immanent goods, for Augustine, have their ultimate end for only in the transcendence of God.

For Augustine, love is not merely an interpersonal ethic, but an orientation of the self towards the ultimate—transcendent—good in the person of God. Similarly, Higden dedicates an early chapter of his treatise to outlining the need for the preacher to proceed with “correctness of intention” (34). That is, the preacher’s goals must be pointed toward the goal of the love of God—he should not pursue any earthier purposes in preaching. Moreover, along with Augustine and other medieval preaching theorists, Higden grounds his rhetoric in the grace of God, insisting that the preacher including a prayer requesting God’s grace upon his message, citing Augustine’s dictum from *DDC* that “the preacher should be a man of prayer before becoming a man of words” (Higden 48). The prayer takes priority over the sermon for Augustine and Higden in order secure God’s blessing for the message, without which it cannot succeed. By placing the sermon within the framework of divine grace, these Christian preachers merely follow St. Paul’s doctrine that while the preacher may plant the seed of Christian faith, “God [gives] the increase” (1 Cor. 3:6, KJV). For Higden, following a classic Christian understanding of God’s grace, the preacher’s service to his audience only comes about through God’s blessing. He concludes his treatment of the prayer with a quote from John 15:5, in which Christ speaks: “Without me, you can do nothing” (Higden 49). Higden’s medieval Christian preaching is thus grounded both in transcendent goals and the support of a transcendent being.

By setting a kairotic, occasional rhetoric within the transcendent framework of divine grace, the rhetoric of Augustine and Higden achieves an incarnational union of the immanent and transcendent. The preacher acts through fully embodied means, but does so with reference to a transcendent being who supports and blesses his work. On the model outlined by Smith, these rhetors seek to enable an appearance of the transcendent in the immanent—a peaceful incarnation rather than a violent reduction. Though God is encountered in other immanent (human) beings, for Augustine or Higden to understand those beings as ends in themselves would be ultimately destructive—they must be encountered with constant reference to the transcendent source of their ultimate good. The rhetorical practice of medieval preaching thus exemplifies person-giving rhetoric as I have outlined it above: an incarnate, communal, confessional, present and timely experience, uniting transcendent and immanent in a truly nonmodern rhetoric.

The person-giving and nonmodern aspects of medieval preaching place it in stark contrast with certain types of sacred rhetoric under the modern constitution, such as the genre of Christian apologetics, which attempts not to practice an incarnational proclamation, but to establish the veridity of faith *in the terms of modern reason.* Examples of the genre include Lee Strobel’s *The Case for Christ,* which uses the methods of an investigative journalist to argue for Christian beliefs, or the work of William Lane Craig, who terms his project to justify Christianity on philosophical grounds “Reasonable Faith” (ReasonableFaith.org). Rather than seeking to build up love through an encounter with the other, these works attempt to make religion sensible on modern terms: that is, to show it to be reasonable, supported by evidence, historically reliable. In short, apologetics operates within the existing framework of modern notions of truth, epistemology, and history. There is, of course, a kind of *kairos* here insofar as these works speak to those whose instincts are governed by the modern constitution, yet insofar as they reinforce that understanding of knowledge and the sacred they lack the more incarnate aspects of sacred rhetoric, its role as the enabler of communion, which scandalizes the modern notion that belief ought to be the kind of thing supported by scientific evidence. Ultimately, medieval or Latourian person-giving depends upon a relationship with the other, not an appeal to modern processes of veridification, to govern a truly speculative and sacred rhetoric. By correlating Latour’s alternative to the modern knowledge regime and the premodern sources of sacred rhetoric, we encounter a style of persuasion shaped by fundamentally different presuppositions and regimes of knowledge. A study of person-giving rhetoric, whether in Latour or medieval sources, thus offers us a nonmodern rhetoric outside the typical binaries of the modern constitution.

## Chapter Four: Charles Taylor: Sacred History

> Our sense of where we are is crucially defined in part by a story of how we got there. In that sense, there is an inescapable (though often negative) God-reference in the very nature of our secular age. And just because we describe where we are in relating the journey, we can misdescribe it grievously by misidentifying the itinerary. . . . To get straight where we are, we have to go back and tell the story properly. - Charles Taylor, *A Secular Age,* 29.

Having looked to Bruno Latour to develop a method for understanding sacred rhetoric, it now remains for me to consider how that rhetoric is deployed in history. Religion as I am pursuing it here—as a social phenomenon and a set of practices as well as a system of beliefs—must always be understood contextually and historically. We never encounter “religion” as such, but only instances of the phenomenon. Moreover, I have argued in my introduction that the field’s misconception of religious rhetoric has led us toward a misshapen story of the history of rhetoric, one which traces the conflicts between philosophy and rhetoric but neglects the crucial third term of religion. If we are to re-tell that story with the proper detail, we need a theory of history, and specifically of religious history.

Like a speculative sacred rhetoric, such a theory of history would need to take religion seriously as a real actor in history. Rather than understanding religious figures, movements, and cultures as driven merely by social factors, economics, or worldviews, a speculative theory of sacred history would understand religion as a source of motivation and historical change on its own terms. It would provide an account of history which allows us to see how religion and other aspects of culture act upon one another as complementary and competing forces to produce historical and cultural states, resisting explanations of history that reduce all causation to a single force, be it economics, the social, or religion itself. In so doing, it would provide a rich framework for understanding how sacred rhetorics—acts of conversion or person-giving—play out in particular circumstances. For such a theory, there is no one better to look to than Charles Taylor.

Taylor has been a critical voice on modernity and religion since at least the publication of his first major work, *Sources of the Self* (hereafter *SS*) in 1989. Through that work along with his monumental *A Secular Age* (hereafter *SA*) Taylor offers an exceptionally subtle, multifaceted account of the place of religion in modernity, one attentive to all the various aspects of religion and culture, including ideas, beliefs, practices, emotions, and material factors. His work in this regard has been influential not just in philosophy[^32] and religion[^33], but also politics and international relations[^34], higher education[^35], and even such far-flung fields as nursing education[^36], video game studies[^37], food studies[^38], and pop culture.[^39] Though Taylor has made his career challenging philosophical consensus—often from an explicitly religious perspective as a Roman Catholic—on such topics as morality, secularism, and language, he has nonetheless found a wide audience.

In rhetorical studies, however, he has largely been ignored. The only notable engagement with his thought in the field thus far has come from a special issue of *Philosophy and Rhetoric,* “The Rhetorical Contours of Recognition,” responding to an essay by Taylor. However, that issue mainly addresses his political thought (and with the very narrow focus of recognition as an ethical and rhetorical act), rather than his work on religion and modernity. Timothy W. Crusius also engages with Taylor peripherally in his exegesis of Burke, and calls for more scholarship on Taylor in rhetoric (229). His call has yet to be answered by the field.

This chapter aims to heed Crusius’s request for further rhetorical consideration of Taylor. It does so by explicating Taylor’s major ideas and linking them to the speculative sacred rhetoric I have developed thus far. Though Taylor is a philosopher, his philosophical thought does not reflect the point of view in that field that rhetoricians traditionally attack—a decontextualized, purely theoretical pursuit of pure ideas and metaphysics in a Cartesian mode.[^40] Rather, Taylor’s Heideggerian background and religious commitments incline him toward a much more dialectical and historicized approach to the work of philosophy. His scholarship attempts not to make a case for certain ideas through a closed logical and philosophical system, but to account for culturally prevalent views—held by philosophers and non-philosophers alike—by offering a dialectical account of their multifaceted history. His understanding of how we arrive at certain perspectives always includes both the influence of ideas and beliefs and material and cultural factors, with neither given priority over the other.[^41] Though Taylor’s training and career have been spent in philosophy, then, from the perspective of a rhetorician—committed to contextualization, non-reductive analysis, and practical reasoning—his is a markedly sympathetic project.

Taylor offers us an exceptionally subtle, multifaceted account of the place of religious thought and experience in history—especially the history of modernity. His method of analysis, based on a style of doing history and an understanding of what he calls “social imaginaries” provides a useful model for historical treatments of sacred rhetoric, while his analysis of modernity, centered around the categories of cross-pressure (which I have already discussed in chapter one) and “the Immanent Frame” help us understand the theoretical context for rhetorical studies and the need for a renewed approach to sacred rhetoric.

### History and the Social Imaginary

Methodologically, Taylor’s work offers a boon to a speculative sacred rhetoric because his mode of doing history and cultural analysis bear out the key elements of such a rhetoric. First of all, Taylor commits himself to historical narration as a means of understanding the cultural situation, as the epigraph to this chapter suggests. In all his work, he attempts to give an account of how we got to our current state, arguing that we cannot understand the situation of belief in the modern world without understanding its history. The task of “counter-history” (borrowed from Byron Hawk) to which I set myself in the final chapter of this dissertation arises from a related conviction that we cannot properly understand the situation of sacred rhetoric until we re-tell the story of rhetorical history.

On its own, Taylor’s commitment to historicism is hardly unique and might even be seen as problematic: after all, history can easily devolve into the sort of humanism that speculative realism set itself against, motivated by a conviction that what *really matters* are the thoughts and actions of human beings, the more powerful the better. History as record of great men and great thoughts assumes the sort of metaphysics and linguistic emphasis my project works against. The power of Taylor’s account, however, and what makes it so valuable from a speculative perspective, lies in how Taylor’s historicism in fact challenges this mode of thinking. Rather than seeing history as primarily driven by human action, great ideas, economics, or any other sweeping, human force, he insists that “the only general rule in history is that there is no general rule in identifying one order of motivation as always the driving force” (*SA,* 213). Accordingly, Taylor pursues an account of historical causation that he calls “diachronic,” in which human ideas and material practices reciprocally influence one another (*SS,* 204). A comprehensive statement of causation, he believes, could hardly be achieved given human limitations, but gesturing toward such a full analysis remains essential. His historical narratives thus move slowly, offering multiple possible sources for any phenomenon, resisting the temptation to give “the” source of any complex of ideas or practices.

One of Taylor’s most critical means of achieving this multifaceted account of history is through emphasizing what he calls the “social imaginary.” Rather than tracing the history of social *theories,* Taylor prefers the term social *imaginaries* for the following reasons:

> \(i) because I’m talking about the way ordinary people ‘imagine’ their social surroundings, and this is often not expressed in theoretical terms, it is carried in images, stories, legends, etc. But it is also the case that (ii) theory is often the possession of a small minority, whereas what is interesting in the social imaginary is that it is shared by large groups of people, if not the whole society. Which leads to a third difference: (iii) the social imaginary is that common understanding which makes possible common practices, and a widely shared sense of legitimacy. (*SA,* 171-72)

In short, Taylor does not aim to write a history of ideas, but a history of *imaginative visions* of social life, which leads to a history of practices. He rejects the implicit assumption of the history-of-ideas model, that philosophers and intellectuals are those who change culture, arguing that in fact such individuals only influence the minority who actually read and study their complex ideas. Instead, Taylor takes the imagination as his target, arguing that for most people—for the culture at large—it is of greater significance than sophisticated theories. This imaginative understanding, he argues, is shaped by social theories, but also, and more fundamentally, by “images, stories, legends, etc.” The social imaginary arises not from the intellectual context of a particular time, but from the total cultural context, including imaginative and material influences. It produces not other theories, but the habits of social life. A shared imaginative vision, then, unites people around shared practices, incorporating “some sense of how we all fit together in carrying out the common practice” (*SA,* 172). Taylor gives the example of a democratic election: “\[p\]art of the background understanding which makes sense of our act of voting for each one of us is our awareness of the whole action” (*SA,* 172). A shared vision of how an election *ought* to go (which is itself based upon imaginative constructions of the founding of the nation, its shared values, and so forth) legitimizes the practice for each individual as an aspect of the common life. In Taylor’s view, these practices are thus authorized not so much by theoretical reflection upon them, but upon the imaginative resources that support them among the majority of the people involved.

In keeping with this orientation toward the imaginative and material, Taylor critiques those explanations of modernity which merely track changes in ideas from the medieval to the modern world, such as those offered by the thinkers associated with Radical Orthodoxy (John Milbank, Graham Ward, Catherine Pickstock), or Rémi Brague’s account of the decline of wisdom. He terms these stories of modernity, collectively, the Intellectual Deviation (ID) story (*SA,* 774). In other words, these narratives of modernity see it as stemming primarily from a philosophical or other intellectual change, as the Radical Orthodoxy story traces modernity’s vices to the rise of nominalism in the late Middle Ages. Modernity comes about through intellectual change on these accounts, with little attention given to material conditions or cultural changes outside the intelligentsia. Taylor does not dismiss the influence of intellectuals and intellectual change: he views the ID story as a necessary component of a full description of modernity. Yet he argues that the ID story must be supplemented with a more holistic narrative that encompasses practices among normal people (as opposed to the intellectual elite who engage with social theories), whose sense of the world may be shaped more by imagination than by cutting edge philosophical speculation. His mode of analysis, based on social imaginaries, aims to offer such a supplement.

We can draw examples of social imaginaries from Taylor’s detailed analysis of modernity. According to Taylor, the modern social imaginary is in part constituted by “three important forms of social self-understanding”: the economy, the public sphere, and “the practices and outlooks of democratic self-rule” (*SA* 176). It is not necessary or possible here to unpack exactly how Taylor sees each of these social forms working; instead, we must grasp why each constitutes a social imaginary rather than a theoretical construct. Each factor in the modern social imaginary is understood as an objective social reality rather than something historically bound—they are taken by most people as “facts of life” rather than contingent cultural creations. They are reinforced by imaginative and material influences, from the stories told by the media to the repetitive practices (one might say the liturgies) of our civic life, such as get-out-the-vote efforts. As imaginative social forms, they shape our self-understanding on a fundamental level, and in a different direction than previous understandings from other eras.

Taylor’s most important work is to explicate modern social imaginaries, the self-understandings of people living in what Latour calls the Modern Constitution. Taylor’s descriptions of human values and practices are aimed at explicating how they add up to a vision of the good life, a picture of how life ought to work. In this way, Taylor concerns himself with questions of morals and purposes, in contrast to other philosophical schools which are more reticent about identifying ultimate ends (see *SS,* 3). One framework within which he discusses the modern forms of self-understanding described above is the “modern moral order,” that is, the imaginative vision within which modern people make moral judgments and reason about ethics (*SA,* 159). At the same time, his scholarship is deeply historicized—he holds to no illusions about articulating a moral philosophy which would be always and everywhere relevant, but aims instead at detailing the precise forms of social imaginary held by people in very specific contexts: most notably, the modern, Western world.

Taylor’s most recent work, *The Language Animal,* carries his project through to an account of language. Although this work is less relevant to my historical project than *SA* and *SS*—being a philosophy of language rather than a theory of history or modernity—it is worth noting briefly how it carries his approach through. In *The Language Animal* Taylor approaches language, as the title would suggest, as an “embodied” phenomenon, rather than a purely intellectual one (333). He considers the rise of language in human evolution, and examines ways in which it exceeds a conventional philosophical model of it as information encoding. The imaginative, embodied perspective of the social imaginary thus shapes Taylor’s approach everywhere in his work.

Taylor’s notion of social imaginaries is invaluable for a speculative sacred rhetoric. Where a conventional rhetoric of religion emphasizes theologies, beliefs, and ideas, a rhetoric influenced by Taylor will look more closely at how believers *imagine* their religion and how that imagination shapes their *practices.* It will thus take seriously those aspects of religion which are more than linguistic and intellectual—the tangible, material, habitual side of religion. In contrast to the reductionism of social theory, which attempts to explain every aspect of religion by reference to the social, the social imaginary *adds* reality—it explains the social by reference to everything else (cf. Latour, “Why Has Critique,” 232). Accordingly, it is consonant with the holistic approach of a sacred rhetoric shaped by speculative realism. Indeed, insofar as religion aims not merely to transform adherents’ beliefs but their whole lives, we could describe religion itself as a thoroughgoing social imaginary. The task of a speculative sacred rhetoric, then, would be to trace the aspects of such an imaginary and how it interacts with other forms of social self-understanding.

### Modes of Imagination

Taylor’s explication of modern social imaginaries includes an almost overwhelming amount of detail across the more than 1,500 combined pages of *SS* and *SA.* Analyzing the whole of his work, then, falls far beyond the scope of this chapter, and I hope that this brief treatment serves only as a beginning for engagement with Taylor from within rhetorical studies. For my purposes as a historian of sacred rhetoric, three aspects of Taylor’s modern social imaginaries stand as particularly relevant, which I will give here using Taylor’s terms of art: cross pressure, the buffered self, and the immanent frame. These terms indicate complex phenomena that have numerous effects, yet they may best be spoken of as modes of the modern social imaginary, aspects of how modern people imagine our place in history and faith. Each has value for how we understand sacred rhetorics across history. I have already analyzed how cross pressure works in my discussion of Burke in chapter one, and so my argument here will mainly focus on the latter two terms, which are closely intertwined. Taylor’s perspective on the “disenchantment” of modern life, which diverges significantly from previous uses of the term, can largely be understood through these two terms, which offer a new understanding of the modern self and its relation to the supernatural.

Fundamental to Taylor’s unique perspective on secularization is his understanding of disenchantment and enchantment. Whereas Max Weber’s use of the negative term has become a commonplace in arguments about the decline of religion in modernity, Taylor finds it meaningful to examine what an *enchanted* world looked like as well, to better grasp what changes led to our current sense of loss. Whereas the traditional, Weberian perspective sees disenchantment purely as a view of the world which reduces everything to the immanent, Taylor sees disenchantment as “the dissolution of the ‘enchanted’ world, the world of spirits and meaningful causal forces, of wood sprites and relics. Enchantment is essential to some forms of religion; but other forms—especially those of modern Reformed Christianity,[^42] both Catholic and Protestant—have been built on its partial or total denial” (553). Enchantment, then, cannot be simply identified with religion, nor does disenchantment necessarily mean the end of religion. Instead, disenchantment signifies a different *relationship* to belief, a different understanding of the conditions of belief. Disenchantment signifies a more fraught, less homogeneous world of faith, not necessarily the loss of faith altogether—it is about a change in the “conditions of belief,” not simply the loss of belief as such (539). From Taylor’s point of view, after modernity believers and nonbelievers alike live in a disenchanted world, and even those who hold to traditional faith do so within a disenchanted framework.

For Taylor, an enchanted world possesses three features that serve as “the bulwarks of belief,” social factors reinforcing religious faith across society (25). These include: the natural world is seen as a site of divine action; the social world is grounded in God’s order; and “spirits, demons, and moral forces” were a constant presence (25-26). Enchantment, then, consists in a pervasive, daily sense of the presence of unseen spiritual forces, both good and evil. These forces act upon the natural world directly—they are not just intangible, immaterial threats. Rather, they can ruin your livelihood or elevate your family’s wellbeing. This is in contrast with a disenchanted idea of the spiritual realm. Even believers, under modernity, do not necessarily have a pervasive, constant sense that angels and demons could change the functioning of their daily lives; they are more likely to connect these forces to the wellbeing of their emotional or spiritual health, without material consequences. Matters are quite different, argues Taylor, in the enchanted world. Enlisting the help of the good and beating back the threat of the evil is a very real concern for people in an enchanted world, and one that requires collective action to protect the village or the society. For virtually everyone, then, “God’s power was there for you in the micro-functioning of your society” (43). That is, the smallest and largest actions (from ritual gestures to ward off curses to annual festivals) made reference to the power of the divine. On Taylor’s account, belief was pervasive in the pre-modern West because all aspects of social life testified to it.

Taylor does not see that social regime as something imposed by religious authorities, however. Instead, he sees it as an understandable reaction to the premodern experience of “the porous self” (38). Premodern people experienced themselves as open to the influence of the spiritual forces which they perceived as being all around them—both for good and ill. Relics of the saints and the sites of their veneration had real spiritual power to cure or sanctify; demon possession was a real and present threat, not just to one’s physical well-being, but to one’s personality and internal life. In an enchanted world, demon possession “can penetrate us as living, willing beings, with our own purposes and intent” (35). A person’s very desires and the essence of her personality could, on this understanding, be transformed by an exterior, hostile force. In the pre-modern world, one’s very self “is porous to some outside power, a person-like power”—both for good and for ill (35). Where this is the existential situation, it is hardly surprising that most people would choose to ally themselves to the benevolent power of church and faith, which promised the ability to help navigate these forces, allying them to the benevolent power of God and warding off the spiritual forces of evil.

Taylor contrasts the porous self with the experience of modernity: instead of porous, we now experience ourselves as having buffered selves (*SA* 300). Even those who still believe fervently in the existence of angels and demons—and plenty such still exist—do not experience these forces as real and present caretakers or threats. Nor do we have collective rituals aimed at placating them. Whereas denizens of an enchanted world have limited barriers between their internal lives and external forces, those with buffered selves “have closed the porous boundary between inside (thought) and outside (nature, the physical)” (300). Our selves are not subject to threat by supernatural forces, nor are they even really threatened by physical forces. We have erected strong barriers between ourselves and external forces of all kinds. For people in an enchanted world, even their emotions are caused by external forces, and we are vulnerable to them no matter our will—in medieval understanding of the humors, “black bile is not the cause of melancholy, it embodies, it *is* melancholy” (37). A premodern person in the grip of the humors is truly in the grip of something. In contrast, “A modern is feeling depressed, melancholy. He is told: it’s just your body chemistry, you’re hungry, or there is a hormone malfunction, or whatever. Straightaway, he feels relieved. He can take a distance from this feeling” (37). Even causes of certain moods that are internal to one’s own body—hormones, appetites—are not seen as touching one’s self, but rather as exterior actors that can be closed off from the essence of the person, in theory if not in practice. For buffered selves, there is no need for a community to protect us from spiritual forces; we are secure in ourselves from their malignant influence in all ways that matter. Though we may believe in a spiritual world, then, it does not impinge upon our daily concerns or our self-interest in the same direct, life-altering way that it for people living under enchantment.

For Taylor, the transformation in modernity of people’s sense of self from porous to buffered also brings with it a changed sense of space and time. Whereas in a world of porous selves space and time are penetrated at every turn by transcendent actors, buffered selves live within what he terms “the immanent frame” (542). In that frame, we see “the natural, ‘physical’ universe as governed by exceptionless laws, which may reflect the wisdom and benevolence of the creator, but don’t require in order to be understood” any reference to God or the divine (542). Under the immanent frame, our experience of the world is one of “instrumental rationality,” in which things happen according to physical laws, not divine commands (542). Even if we believe these laws reflect the goodness of the divine, that reflects only upon the goodness of their existence *as they are*—it does not suggest that the supernatural might actually infringe upon them. Taylor’s perspective here is not unlike Latour’s discussion of “the crossed-out God” as discussed in chapter one: modernity simply assumes that the divine *must* be bracketed, crossed out, in order for science and the modern constitution to function as it should (*WHNBM,* 33). Thus, just as modern people possess selves buffered from experiences of the supernatural, the physical world too possesses a buffer from interference by deities or supernatural forces.

In contrast, for those who possess porous selves, every aspect of life—from the moral law to the changing of the seasons—is a potential ground for the action of spirits and forces beyond the instrumental action of immanent beings. Moreover, immanent spaces and times exist with reference to sacred spaces and higher times, so that a church or a particular time of year may resonate, not merely in imagination but by its nature, with the power of the transcendent. There is no realm of the purely natural, because the entire cosmos relates to the transcendent. Buffered individuals struggle even to imagine what it would be like to live in such a world. The buffered self “moves in a constructed social space, where instrumental rationality is a key value, and time is pervasively secular” (542). Social spaces are determined by human beings rather than divine influence, nature is a realm of rational cause and effect rather than mystery, and no time is higher or more sacred than any other. For buffered selves, nature “may or may not be in interaction with something further or beyond,” but because that which is beyond does not impinge upon nature in any causal manner, it never truly penetrates the immanent frame. A recent example of this shift in perspective was evident at the appointment of Sonny Perdue as the US Secretary of Agriculture. The Washington Post described him on Twitter as “former Georgia governor, who once prayed for rain” (Post Politics). The faint whiff of incredulity in that formal journalistic descriptor was, as one might expect, magnified greatly by social media users who mocked Perdue’s attempt to influence the world through prayer.[^43] A person within the immanent frame may pray, but to expect that prayer to actually effect anything—especially if one is expected to work on that matter oneself—falls outside our imaginative norms.

For Taylor, everyone in the West lives within the immanent frame, whether they believe in something beyond it or not. The difference rests not between those who are modern and secular and those who are spiritual, but in our respective takes on the immanent frame—whether we “want to live it as open to something beyond . . . [or] live it as closed” (544). On this reading, those whose understandings of space and time fit within the immanent frame may nonetheless experience that frame as open to transcendence. Whereas some will accept the terms of the immanent frame and adopt a “closed take,” others can, without escaping the immanent frame, accept it as open to transcendence, albeit in forms that may not disrupt the immanent regime (553). Taylor cites the American Great Awakening movements of the 18th and 19th centuries (545). The churches and movements that arose from the various waves of revival during that period—charismatics, evangelicals, and nondenominational Christians—largely discarded the rituals that the church had previously used to create a sense of sacred space and time. They rejected the Christian calendar as unbiblical as well as other trappings of liturgical life that served to communicate a sense of sacred space and time, including incense, bells, vestments, and so forth. Instead, stripped of liturgical ornamentation, services in these movements centered on preaching and singing, both activities that remained relatively comprehensible within the immanent frame as forms of ordinary 19th century public life. Believers in these traditions remain, by and large, within the constructed social space of modernity, and their experience of God is largely private and individual, rather than communal. They thus remain within the immanent frame, yet their experience of God within the self has incredible power to change attitudes, behaviors, and ways of life—as seen by evangelical promotion of such social causes as temperance and abolition of slavery. Sonny Perdue himself, as a Baptist, comes from such a tradition, and accordingly sees no contradiction between praying for rain and declaring a state of emergency and water rationing (Lohr). Believers in modernity thus should not be seen as rejecting the immanent frame—often they accept it but retain a notion of its openness, in one way or another, to transcendence.[^44]

On my analysis from chapter two, Burke is another, quite different, example of this “open take” on transcendence. Though strongly buffeted by the cross pressures of modernity and deeply shaped by a commitment to the modern moral order, Burke’s fascination with transcendence never quite fades. Burke’s grappling with what Wayne C. Booth terms “the mysterious source” of value distinctions marks him out as, if not a believer per se, one with an open take on the transcendent. Within the immanent frame, often such openness—rather than a full-hearted embrace of enchantment—may be all that is on offer. Everyone—believers, skeptics, and those with a more complex relation to faith like Burke—lives within the immanent frame, and the difference is not between those who escape it and those who do not, but between degrees of openness to a glimmer of transcendence. Burke, on my analysis, falls within the open camp, cross pressured as he may be.

At the same time, Taylor finds many thinkers who hold a closed take on the immanent frame, seeing the search for transcendence as a distraction or even a menace to our pursuit of immanent goods. Taylor cites figures like Gibbon, Voltaire, and Hume as examples of those with a “closed” take, one that rejects the potential for transcendence altogether. For those with a closed take on modernity, strong commitments to theological beliefs or church institutions “will split a society which should be intent simply on securing mutual benefit. Or else, the demand that we reach for some higher good, beyond human flourishing, at best will distract us, at worst will become the basis for demands which will again endanger the well-oiled order of mutual benefit” (546). Transcendence, on this way of thinking, offers at best a distraction and at worst an active threat to the pursuit of our immanent goals. In recent years, New Atheist figures like Christopher Hitchens have argued that adherence to the transcendent causes violence, sexual repression, and indeed much of the evil in the world (see Hitchens 4). Such arguments against religion are less based in modern science (though they tend to be cloaked as scientific) than in a moral impulse to care for the things of this world. Hitchens rails against evil in the world and “religious atrocities” with all the fervor of the moralist; he is far from the figure of the dispassionate, scientifically driven skeptic (8). Much like Latour’s critique of “bad transcendence,” thinkers of this bent see the immanent world as threatened by attention paid to something beyond, and thus raise moral objections to interest in the supernatural. The growth of civilization, on such accounts, depends upon deepening and strengthening the immanent frame that will direct human energies toward immanent goods achieved through politics, science, and practical action. These moral objections to the supernatural make sense of William H. Rueckert’s take on Burke as a secularizing figure, aimed at producing a secular faith “designed to save man in this world” (134). Though my analysis of Burke as cross pressured suggests that his take may be more open, Rueckert here clearly accepts the terms of the immanent frame, that the only legitimate human effort is directed toward “this world.” He is thus aligned with the closed take on transcendence. The closed take on transcendence also accounts for the discomfort Latour expresses in talking about religion and his aversion to transcendence. Though drawn to faith, he is plainly cross pressured by an awareness of closed takes on transcendence all around him, such that he experiences religion as “impossible to enunciate” (*On the Modern,* 103). His continued interest in the closeness and distance created by person-giving rhetoric, however, marks him as maintaining an open take by the slimmest of margins. Though he insists that religion is not about grasping “a bit of transcendence,” the room for transcendence (properly understood) that my third chapter uncovers means we cannot understand him as holding a purely closed take along the lines of a Gibbon or Hitchens (*Rejoicing,* 33). Though the presence of closed takes on transcendence contribute to the discomfort of holding to religion under the immanent frame, they do not rule it entirely out of bounds, even for a figure like Latour, nor do they suggest that it is in inevitable decline.

As with other aspects of Taylor’s thought on secularism and modernity, then, the emphasis is not so much upon loss of belief than upon changed contexts for it. On Taylor’s account, modernity comes about not so much through an intellectual rejection of the old faith, but a changed set of stories and cultural circumstances that leads to new understandings of the cosmos, the self, space and time. Much like Burke’s understanding of orientation or Latour’s person-giving rhetoric, religious persuasion on this account takes place much less on the level of discursive argument around doctrines, and much more through shaping imaginations and habits of life. Taylor’s account of the imaginative and habituated sources of modern attitudes supports such sacred rhetoric by helping us understand its rhetorical situation more fully. My discussion of his account—condensing two 600-plus page books into a single brief chapter—is necessarily highly incomplete and even reductive, yet even this brief analysis gives a sense of the provocative force of his thought. A speculative sacred rhetoric, as I argued in my introduction, must understand religion on its own terms as a unique contributor to rhetorical thought and human culture. Taylor supports this project through an account of religion—before and after modernity—that gives us a window into perceptions and instincts that shape people on a more fundamental level than theories and dogmas, including those of the enchanted world that are foreign to our own. His notions of enchantment, the self, and the immanent frame are invaluable explanatory tools for speculative rhetorical analysis of sacred rhetorics from any historical period.

### Unquiet Frontiers

I will now undertake a small case study of how Taylor’s thought can be applied, as I have done in turn for Burke and Latour. Though one might expect an analysis of premodern rhetoric—the enchanted thought that I have argued Taylor helps us understand as no other thinker does—in fact I want to examine a distinctly modern sacred rhetoric. This is because in order to avoid giving the impression that Taylor creates a strong binary between premodern and modern. On the contrary, much as with Latour’s articulation of a nonmodern project, Taylor does not tell a story of simple historical revolutions. Though the brevity of my treatment requires putting his argument in stark terms, in fact Taylor insists that “The account I’m offering here has no place for unproblematic breaks with a past which is simply left behind us” (772). Taylor’s historical methods do not allow for neat historical breaks or sharp binaries; instead, he sees circumstances shifting gradually and inconsistently. Hence his distinctions between, for instance “open” and “closed” takes on the immanent frame, which exposes both continuities and discontinuities in religious thought between the premodern and contemporary believers. In fact, Taylor concludes *SA* by looking at points of tension within the immanent frame, at ideological dilemmas, conversions, and what he calls “unquiet frontiers of modernity”—that is, “sites of unease with the closed perspective on the immanent frame” (711). “Open takes” on modernity, for Taylor, are not solely the province of individual believers: they may also inhere in certain phenomena. Festive or transcendent experiences—aesthetic experiences, romance, nostalgia—may trouble the boundaries of the closed take on the immanent frame and re-engage modern people with an experience of transcendence. In a sense, Taylor sees the moral impulse to care for the immanent world and the equally moral longing for something beyond as perennial aspects of human personality, such that no culture can exclude either one or the other. Accordingly, he finds many sites within the immanent frame where the enchanted world reasserts itself, such as in festive events or moments of public mourning, thus suggesting that closed takes on the immanent frame never have the last word (715). My case study in conclusion of this chapter will look at one such site in the worship and rhetoric of a contemporary Pentecostal/charismatic church, Bethel Church of Redding, California.

Before beginning my analysis of Bethel Church’s rhetoric as an unquiet frontier of modernity, it may be helpful to briefly outline the history of Pentecostalism. Although Taylor largely looks to the secular world for exemplars of the unquiet frontiers of modernity, religion has its own version of the phenomenon in Pentecostal or Charismatic movements. Although now a broader trend that touches even the Catholic Church, Pentecostalism arose within radically Reformed, evangelical Protestant groups (see Blumhofer, *Restoring the Faith* 12). These nineteenth-century movements (Reformed, Baptist, or Restorationist) aimed to restore the simple faith of the early church, but they understood that task in a way deeply shaped by the immanent frame, as leading to a church life focused on the rational discourse of preaching and the practical, immanent work of social action (see Hughes; also Hughes and Allen). Rather than stressing the mystery of the sacraments or the beauty of liturgy, nineteenth-century revivalism focused upon the immanent actions of moral growth and social action. These movements understood primitive Christianity as simple, practical, and rational, rejecting the Catholic (or classic Protestant) supernaturalism that revered the Eucharist and practiced devotions to saints, the observation of holy days, and other devotions redolent of the enchanted world. Pentecostalism came from within this primitivist world, but shifts back toward enchantment to some degree by placing the locus of “restorationist yearning” not with the more immanent aspects of early Christianity, but with the supernatural spiritual gifts described as coming to the church in the Book of Acts: speaking in tongues (glossolalia), miraculous healings, and other, more unusual signs and wonders (Blumhofer, *Restoring the Faith* 12). Believers within this tradition look for such spiritual gifts as a sign that they have received the Holy Spirit—in general, such gifts are expected to appear in the lives of Christians, not as something exceptional but as the normal fruits of salvation. In keeping with this emphasis on the active work of the Holy Spirit in the individual lives of Christians as well as the radical Protestant background of the movement, charismatic worship services are typically highly informal and emotive. By combining the social action of revivalism with a renewed sense of the movement of the Holy Spirit, these groups make an outstanding example of an open take on the immanent frame. Though their emphasis on moral teaching and social action over sacramentality places them well within the immanent frame, their openness to the supernatural often makes them sites of Taylor’s “unquiet frontiers.”

Bethel Church is notable among contemporary charismatic churches for its size (over 8,000 weekly attendees) and the influence it exercises through its various ministries, including the Bethel School of Supernatural Ministry, an unaccredited program which trains believers from around the world in the school’s ministry techniques (Jones). The church has attained this prominence in no small part through its claims of supernatural events such as healings and mysterious signs. In a report for the mainstream evangelical publication *Christianity Today,* writer Martyn Wendell Jones describes the church’s claims—and the controversy that attends them—as follows:

> At Bethel, I had heard, people are healed all the time. The church keeps a log of healing stories on their website. YouTube videos seem to show glittering clouds of material falling from the ceiling that Bethel people identify as “gold dust.” They also report an occasional admixture of “angel feathers” and a “Shekinah glory cloud.” There are those here who cast out demons and raise the dead.
>
> At least they claim to. Throngs of Christians argue that Bethel is a damaging presence in the American church, and that the miracles are false. Bart McCurdy, an evangelical in Redding, told me that in the church’s preaching and teaching, “there is never a call for repentance or faith in Christ—never. It is all about experience and signs and wonders.” (Jones)

On this account, Bethel Church draws its success and its infamy in equal measure from its status as an unquiet frontier, a site of enchantment amidst the immanent order. By claiming transcendent signs and wonders, the church violates the imaginative norms of the immanent frame, even for other believers in the transcendent, such as Bart McCurdy (or, for that matter, Jones, who maintains his skepticism throughout reporting on the church despite publishing in an evangelical Christian publication).[^45] Rather than accepting the buffered self, adherents at Bethel believe that God’s “manifest presence” results in “personal revival,” that is, clear spiritual gifts that touch the core of the individual (*iBethel.org*). These transcendent signs and wonders are not merely symbolic or internal, but manifest themselves so publicly that they can be documented on video (see “Glory Cloud Rises at Bethel Church”). It would be hard to identify a site more calculated to incite disquiet in the immanent frame. If Taylor is right that many people with an open take on the immanent frame feel the loss of tangible transcendence, then it is no wonder Bethel Church has attained its prominence, no matter how we view the reality of their signs and wonders. Cross-pressured believers, we might guess, would be relieved to find reason to embrace an enchanted view of the cosmos.

Yet strangely, the church’s appeal to outsiders operates within a fairly immanent register. Most notably, the main website for the church and its associated ministries, *iBethel.org*, eschews most if not all imagery that would suggest a church, religious experience, or the experience of the miraculous (see Figure 1).

Instead, the site heavily features attractive but ambiguous imagery of fashionably dressed young people moving away from the camera across a rugged landscape. The skillfully placed text and clean web design could be those of a fashion brand or a lifestyle magazine. As of the date of access (February 18, 2017), the front page of the site is structured much like any promotional or sales-oriented website: as the user scrolls down the page, the site displays through various content areas meant to push the user through the site and keep them engaged with it by reading other pages. The page concludes with a final call to action—again reflecting the influence of marketing-focused web design—that prompts the reader to further engagement: listening to a podcast, watching a video, or visiting the online store. The text of the site revolves around two central themes: “on Earth as it is in Heaven” (the site’s tagline, drawn from the Lord’s Prayer, Matthew 6:10) and the term “revival.” Though this language is certainly distinctive to the church’s emphasis on signs and wonders, it is deployed ambiguously on the front page of the site and the first-level pages. Only by going deeply into the site, to pages not promoted on the homepage, does one begin to see the language of “signs, wonders, and miracles” emerge (“About”). The public face of the church, then, presents a person with a closed take on the immanent frame with little that is shocking. Although the site promotes Bethel’s associated schools, which aim to teach students supernatural gifts like spiritual healing, it does so using generic language of “revival” and “transformation,” even referring to their flagship school as “a safe space for you to learn your identity” (“Schools”). At the same time, the church promotes the kind of more traditional, moral content characteristic of much mainstream evangelicalism, such as classes on marriage or business leadership (“Love After Marriage 5-Day Intensive,” “Business Executive Spiritual Reboot 2017”). Watching the church’s worship videos on YouTube also reveals a public presentation that resembles a contemporary pop concert more than anything else, featuring a full band and a light show (see “Great is the LORD; WORSHIP bethel Church”).

Observing that Bethel presents itself in a manner that frequently downplays the church’s more outrageous claims is not to accuse the church of being disingenuous.[^46] Rather, it is to demonstrate that the immanent frame remains operative even at its most unquiet fringes. Though Bethel’s leaders may see themselves as operating within an enchanted cosmos, they would appear to view that enchantment as an experience that cannot be simply assumed with outsiders, but that must only be introduced to those who have been drawn deeper into the movement. Moreover, in order to so communicate their enchanted view of things, they draw freely on the techniques of the deeply immanent order of consumer capitalism and entertainment, distancing themselves from the traditional language and imagery by which churches have often presented themselves such as explicit citation of Scripture or images of crosses or stained glass. Instead, they make a generic appeal. In a disenchanted world, even those who experience (or claim to experience) the supernatural as a present reality and tangible force cannot imagine communicating this to their neighbors without immanentizing it to a large degree.

Taylor’s historical analysis of enchantment and disenchantment thus provides a framework for understanding the place of supernatural experience and the buffered self in sacred rhetorics. Though Bethel undoubtedly provides an example of one of Taylor’s “unquiet frontiers,” where the boundaries of the immanent frame are troubled by phenomena that suggest the existence of a transcendent order, the church’s reticence about promoting those experiences—and the deeply modern ways they market themselves in general—suggest the power of the immanent order and the buffered self. Sacred rhetorics in modernity, whether the cross-pressured arguments of Burke and Latour or the work of Bethel Church, thus must always reckon with modernity and its fraught relationship to transcendence. Because Taylor helps us understand this, his work is invaluable. Before turning to my counter-history, I will conclude this chapter with a brief synthesis of my three key interlocutors, Burke, Latour, and Taylor, showing how their work can help rhetoricians take religion seriously, uncovering it as central to the rhetorical tradition and a key third term in debates over philosophy and rhetoric.

### Toward a Speculative Rhetoric of Religion

As I argued in my introduction to this dissertation, taking religion seriously as a source of rhetorical practice must first and foremost acknowledge that religion extends beyond ideas, beliefs, and worldviews to practices, habits, and embodied rhetorics (buildings, music, sacraments). Whereas Burke’s *RR* has tended to encourage rhetoricians to engage with religion on the level of language, a speculative sacred rhetoric considers religion in its embodied aspects as well. The Burke of *PC,* with his understanding of the embodied quality of orientation, can better help us toward that goal, as can Latour’s understanding of person-giving and Taylor’s richly detailed theory of social imaginaries. Against the classically Burkean reduction of religion to language and ideas, emphasizing the material adds back in what has been removed, but not to insist upon it as the essence of the phenomenon. In order to meaningfully intervene in the purported philosophy/rhetoric binary (the IJsseling story, as I termed it in my introduction) with the third term of religion, we must note that rather than opposing language/ideas and materiality/practices, sacred rhetorics bring them together.

Moreover, where the IJsseling story also embraces a polar opposition between transcendence and immanence, a speculative sacred rhetoric unites these terms as well. As conventionally understood, philosophy concerns itself with transcendent truth, while rhetoric sticks to the realm of the immanent. Both Burke and Latour intervene in this opposition in their own way. Speculative sacred rhetoric, however, refuses the binary, uniting transcendence and immanence through a methodology both speculative and methodically committed to tracing the work of particular actors. Taylor serves as a model here, as his work combines an openness to the mysterious workings of enchantment with a meticulous historical realism. Combining concepts drawn from Burke and Latour (orientation and person-giving) with Taylor’s historical and speculative sensibilities thus gives us a rich and responsive theoretical framework for reconfiguring the history of sacred rhetoric.

Such a history intervenes in the IJsseling story by taking religion seriously as both linguistic and material, transcendent and immanent. Properly understood, Burke, Latour, and Taylor all contribute much to this project. The framework for such a project draws mainly on the understanding of modernity and the task of rhetoric articulated by Latour and Taylor. With Latour, a speculative sacred rhetoric rejects the methodological and epistemological categories of modernity, particularly the critical project which would deny the possibility of speculation and the crossing out of God that reduces religion to the private. Similarly, such a rhetoric draws from Taylor a commitment to follow the historical actors and, through his understanding of enchantment, a speculative understanding of transcendence that makes it accessible once more to rhetorical scholarship. In his discussion of the buffered self and the immanent frame, Taylor demonstrates that we should not take for granted that rhetorical studies must bracket the transcendent and the supernatural in favor of a purely linguistic or social analysis.

Such a nonmodern sacred rhetoric need not accept the pre-existing categories of religious studies as critiqued by Russell T. McCutcheon (see my discussion in chapter one). The traditional understanding of the sacred as articulated by Mircea Eliade figures the sacred as a universal, private, but nonetheless real experience; such a definition, however, accepts the crossed out God of modernity and insists upon a divinity which can sacralize nothing but one’s own experience. A speculative sacred rhetoric rejects this privatization, for, on Taylor’s understanding, “living in the enchanted, porous world of our ancestors was inherently living socially” (*SA,* 42). In cultures existing within an enchanted world, spiritual forces impinge upon the social as much or perhaps even more than private experience—hence Taylor’s signature example of beating the bounds, a *necessarily social* ritual by which the village as a whole acted to protect each member’s soul. For Taylor, openness to the sacred brings not greater privitization and inwardness, but greater social interpenetration due to the need for communal action in spiritual matters. A speculative understanding of religion drawing on Taylor thus agrees with McCutcheon that religion is social, but does not accept it as merely social. Instead, following Latour and Taylor, we can speculate about experiences and forces that stretch beyond what is empirically observable. By tracing the actors involved in a given sacred rhetoric, we can produce an approximation of what it might feel like to live in an enchanted society, much as practitioners of speculative realism seek to paraphrase the experiences of stones, aerosol cans, or software. By understanding religion religiously, we achieve not a more rigorous, certain understanding, but perhaps a more fruitful one for understanding sacred rhetorics from medieval *artes praedicandi* to the worship of Bethel Church.

A full understanding of sacred rhetoric must thus reckon with that sense of enchantment which, Taylor demonstrates, has been pervasive in certain contexts. Because Taylor does not accept the modern crossing out of God, his perspective helps us see the distinctive rhetorical contributions of an enchanted social imaginary. Despite the cross pressure we can see operating in Bethel Church’s website, the rhetorical appeal of a movement based upon the experience of signs and wonders does not resolve to either pure transcendence or pure immanence—to ideology or the social. Rather, the appeal of such a movement is based upon the attractiveness of an open take on the cosmos experienced in community—the Bethel Church glory cloud is an experience both transcendent and immanent, spiritual and ineffable as well as embodied and social. Worshippers experience something that opens up their cosmos to a mysterious kind of enchantment, yet they experience it through bodily means and in a community. Moreover, the event is documented using the banal technologies of the twenty-first century: smartphones, YouTube. Such an experience cannot be resolved into any simple binary of transcendence and immanence, but must be parsed using Taylor’s more detailed framework. Even more than Latour, then, Taylor takes us toward a sacred rhetoric with immense explanatory power for liturgies and religious experiences of many types.

Within this speculative framework, the best means of understanding particular sacred rhetorics is to think with the conceptual tools of religion themselves. We cannot do this by reducing religion to theology and doctrine, following the Burke of *RR,* but must instead think with the more expansive concepts I have developed over the past three chapters. At their best, I have argued, Burke and Latour do this with their concepts of orientation and person giving, and so my counter-history will continue to work with those terms, as well as Taylor’s understanding of the social imaginary and enchantment. Equally important, however, are the rhetorical affordances that religion itself provides: liturgies, works of art, ways of life. A speculative sacred rhetoric will give equal place to thinking religiously with these conceptual tools as to the work of theorists like Latour and Taylor. My final chapter and counter-history, then, seeks to fulfill my understanding of Latour and Taylor by surpassing them, thinking with them in order to go beyond them into the rhetorical riches of a tradition where the sacred takes its rightful place in conversation with philosophy and rhetoric.

## Chapter Five: A Short Counter-history of Sacred Rhetoric

> There will always be a need for new counter-histories. - Byron Hawk, *A Counter-history of Composition,* 262.

I began this dissertation with the charge that rhetoricians have neglected to account fully for the place of sacred rhetorics in histories of the rhetorical tradition. Addressing this neglect, I argued, requires a *speculative sacred rhetoric,* a notion of religion and rhetoric which takes religion seriously as the third term in the ancient conflict between philosophy and rhetoric as recounted in what I term the IJsseling story. Such a rhetoric requires both theoretical articulation—which I have provided through my interactions with Kenneth Burke, Bruno Latour, and Charles Taylor—and a retrieval of historical resources, which I will now provide in the form of a counter-history of the rhetorical tradition.

If we are to give sacred rhetoric its due, we must conceive of the history of our discipline not as “rhetoric and philosophy in conflict” but as “rhetoric, philosophy, and religion in relation.” Deborah K. Shuger has already brought us some distance in this regard with her work *contra* Stanley Fish, considered in my introduction. By looking to early modern religious rhetorics, Shuger shows that the binary Fish sets up between philosophy/rationality/truth and rhetoric/emotion/power cannot account for religious rhetoric, which fully engages the emotions in the search for truth through what she terms “passionate knowledge” (54). For Shuger, religion as the middle term between philosophy and rhetoric allows us to reconfigure the relationship between truth and emotion, for while religion is unfailingly concerned with truth (understood through doctrine, and leading to an ethic), it also unfailingly grounds that truth in emotional assent and embodied experience. Shuger’s work demonstrates conclusively this relationship in the work of early modern rhetoricians, yet properly understood her argument applies across the history of rhetoric. If early modern religious rhetoricians like Juan Luis Vives unite doctrine and persuasion, truth and emotion, religious rhetorics at large do the same. Yet, Shuger argues, the conventional story of rhetoric merely ignores the influence of religion.

Moreover, I have demonstrated throughout this dissertation that when the discipline *does* engage with religion, it often does so in a manner that vacates its power to do the work Shuger assigns to it. Treatments of sacred rhetoric that engage with religion exclusively in the realm of ideas and beliefs—theology and doctrine—in the wake of Kenneth Burke’s *RR* ultimately reduce it to another aspect of the philosophy/rhetoric binary, concerned with abstract truth and power rather than bodies, emotions, and ways of life. We see this in the *RR* itself as well as the linguistic focus of treatments of the subject by Maddux and others, covered in chapter one. Furthering Shuger’s project to break down the binary story would require re-telling the story of sacred rhetoric in such a way that its embodied aspects could become clear, because only in such rhetorical affordances (rituals, sacred places, habits of being) does the religious unity of doctrine and persuasion, truth and emotion, become clear.

Accordingly, in this final chapter, I offer a short survey of sacred rhetorics across the tradition, a first step toward a reconsideration of the tradition at large. Some of these figures and works have always been always been thought of as rhetorical, but their religious character has been overlooked. Others have always been known to be religious, but their import for rhetoric has been missed. I make no pretense to a comprehensive treatment, but merely seek to provide a few touchpoints from which to begin what I believe is necessary: a reconsideration of the discipline conceived not in binary opposition to philosophy, but in a triadic relationship of rhetoric, philosophy, and religion. My counter-history will interact primarily with two existing histories of rhetoric: Patricia Bizzell and Bruce Herzberg’s anthology *The Rhetorical Tradition,* as the most comprehensive current history of the field; and Samuel IJsseling’s *Rhetoric and Philosophy in Conflict* as a key text for the narrative of conflict between rhetoric and philosophy. My aim in correlating my discussion to these texts is not to expose them as biased or worthy of critique, but merely to demonstrate how sacred rhetoric can intervene in the existing historiographical conversation. Though my counter-history does claim, to an extent, to demonstrate a lack in traditional histories of rhetoric, it is with the acknowledgment that such lacks are inevitable, even necessary. Rather than attempting a critical dismantling of the narratives of Bizzell and Herzberg or IJsseling, my counter-history stands aside them in dialectical tension, aiming to provide further historical resources for contemporary rhetoricians.

With regard to the histories of rhetoric, I argue that both Bizzell and Herzberg’s anthology and IJsseling’s history manifest the binary story advocated by Fish, of conflict between rhetoric and philosophy. In Bizzell and Herzberg, this narrative appears mainly in the absence of sacred rhetoricians and religious themes—as my historical discussion will show, their anthology tends to focus upon secular concerns, even in the thought of avowedly religious figures like Augustine. The case of IJsseling is somewhat more complex given the presence in his work of a distinct chapter on “sacred eloquence” (pp. 75-83). IJsseling acknowledges that sacred rhetoric is “a genre in itself” and “of utmost importance” (75). His treatment of the subject mainly examines sacred eloquence as a field for the conflict between rhetoric and philosophy, however, rather than seeing religion as its own actor. He divides the subject into preaching, identified with rhetoric and thus the subject of “utter contempt” by philosophers (76), and theology, which has grown more metaphysical and thus philosophical after Plato (79). The chapter concludes rather strangely with a consideration of the violence of theology and a discussion of Nietzsche’s critique of Christianity, with preaching praised insofar as it opposes metaphysics, and no further (83). Thus, even insofar as historians of rhetoric have considered sacred rhetoric, they have done so within the pre-existing categories of that history. A recovery of sacred rhetoric for the tradition is warranted.

Drawing on my engagement with Burke, Latour, and Taylor, I will show further how their work (orientation, person-giving, enchantment) can help us with the recovery project. More broadly, though, if we are to fully recover religion as an essential category for the history of rhetoric, we must look to those aspects of sacred rhetoric that particularly challenge our existing categories. As I have already suggested through my arguments for the importance of liturgy and embodiment, that means especially looking at those aspects of religious persuasion that fall outside traditional definitions of rhetoric. Rather than this chapter trotting out a parade of preachers and theologians for consideration, it looks most closely at those aspects of religion which extend beyond the purely linguistic and theoretical: rituals, kinaesthetics, aesthetics, and ways of life. Far from offering merely “complex theories of transcendence” (Burke, *RR,* 5), sacred rhetorics operate on bodies through liturgy and ways of life. An appropriately religious history of rhetoric must therefore be, in no small part, a history of liturgy.

### Christian Worship as Rhetoric

If, as I have argued throughout this dissertation, sacred rhetoric considers bodies, aesthetics, habits, and ways of life *as well as* doctrines and language, then Christian worship represents a uniquely influential and thoroughgoing rhetoric in the Western tradition. Conventionally rhetorical thought remains critical to a history of sacred rhetoric, yet such discursive, theoretical work is only one part of such a history. A consideration of other, non-discursive rhetorics is also required, and Christian worship—a central activity, in its multifarious forms, for all Christians—is certainly among the most historically relevant of such rhetorics. Certainly, worship practices have already appeared in the rhetorical tradition to a degree in consideration of works on preaching, a critical piece of many if not most public Christian worship assemblies. Although histories of rhetoric do not engage with these liturgical resources to any great degree, at least one notable work of rhetorical scholarship on liturgy exists in the edited collection *Language and the Worship of the Church,* which features contributions from such notable figures as George A. Kennedy, David Jasper, Peter Mack, and David Crystal. Although the volume offers valuable insights into the history and philosophy of liturgical language, it remains resolutely focused on *language,* as the title suggests, with the exception of a brief treatment of music by Raymond Warren (“Music and the Liturgy,” pp. 196-211). A whole range of other practices and rhetorical affordances could be examined, including architecture, the sacraments, liturgical dress and decoration, fellowship gatherings, and so forth. A history of rhetoric incorporating such phenomena has yet to be produced. My examination of rhetorical figures throughout the rest of this history will draw upon consideration of such elements, considered rhetorically. Yet in order to provide context, both historical and liturgical, for these more focused treatments, it is worth looking briefly at Christian worship in total as a rhetorical system.

Despite the diversity of forms and practices found across its long history, the essential elements of worship remain fairly constant (the assembly of the church, the hearing of the Word, and the practice of the sacraments), and they correspond closely to the terms I have developed for sacred rhetoric from Burke, Latour, and Taylor. Through assembly as the gathered church, Christians develop their *orientation*; through hearing the Word of God, they engage in *person-giving*; and through the practice of the sacraments, they experience a ritual that forms a *social imaginary.* By looking at some of the earliest considerations of Christian practices, I will demonstrate these characteristics to be an early, shaping influence on the church that can be seen to extend throughout its history.

My discussion of early Christian worship practices will draw upon Everett Ferguson’s *Early Christians Speak,* an essential work by an eminent scholar of early church history. Engaging with Ferguson’s work allows me to engage with a variety of primary sources, as he excerpts relevant passages about different aspects of the early church from numerous early sources, as well as providing his own authoritative commentary. Since no single primary author or document provides a full consideration of early Christian worship, drawing upon Ferguson (and some other secondary treatments) provides the best overview for the purpose of a rhetorical history.

#### Assembly as Orientation

Christian worship begins in the gathering together of believers, the assembly of the church. Regular gatherings have been part of the life of the Christian church from its earliest days, as attested by the New Testament account of the apostolic church, described as meeting “daily” in its earliest period (Acts 2:46, KJV) and later “on the first day of the week,” that is, Sunday (Acts 20:7, RSV). The practice continued into the second century, as Ferguson describes: it was “taken for granted \[among Christians\] that one would be in the assembly on Sunday if possible. In spite of the threat of persecution Christians did not give up their corporate assemblies” (73). Gathering together for worship regularly thus served as a central activity of Christian life.

Early Christian sources insist that the assembly was vital for community life among Christians, as argued in the pseudonymous *Epistle of Barnabas*: “You are not to retire by yourself and live alone as if you were already righteous, but you are to come together in one place and seek the common good” (19.10, qtd. in Ferguson 67). For the author of the epistle, the assembly serves both the individual believer—who is not “already righteous” without the assembly—as well as the good of the community. According to Ferguson, the regular assembly was important for ideological reinforcement—protecting individual Christians against schism or heresy—but also for moral purposes, protecting the members against failures like pride by requiring them to interact and bear with one another (73). The attitudes built up in the assembly thus were meant to expand into the rest of the believer’s life, as described in the apocryphal *Second Epistle of Clement*: “Let us not seem merely to believe and give attention now while we are being admonished by the elders, but also when we have gone home let us remember the commandments of the Lord and not be drawn away by worldly desires” (17.3, qtd. in Ferguson 68). The teachings and habits of the assembly thus served to combat evil desires throughout life, even during times when believers were not assembled together.

In my previous discussion of Burke, I defined his notion of orientation in the simplest terms as a “bundle of judgments that create a self-perpetuating interpretation of the world.” For Burke, systems of orientation build upon themselves to create a coherent way of interpreting signs. An orientation is thus built up by a variety of linguistic and non-linguistic interpretations of signs and events, a collection of ways of responding to the world that are mutually reinforcing. These responses show “clearly the integral relationship between our metaphysics and our conduct” (*PC* 14). Orientation thus links belief and action as mutually reinforcing.

The early Christian assembly thus serves as a means of building up an orientation insofar as it intends to create a self-perpetuating attitude toward the world. As believers regularly gather, they are taught attitudes and gain habits that shape their way of living throughout their life in the world—including the habit of gathering regularly itself. The linguistic habits of prayer and preaching and the bodily habits of gathering, kneeling, and eating all serve together to reinforce shared attitudes, beliefs, and ultimately a shared way of acting in the world.

#### The Person-giving Word

Person-giving rhetoric, as I defined it in my discussion of Latour, also has a place in the early liturgy. In my second chapter, I defined Latour’s notion of person-giving as a type of speech that does not attempt to communicate information (as in scientific speech) or bond a group (as in political speech), but rather seeks to bring messenger and recipient closer together, as in expressions of love. Though person-giving could be applied to various aspects of the life of the early church, one clear place where person-giving appears is in the early liturgy of the Word, that is, the portion of worship dedicated to the reading and preaching of the Scriptures.

Readings from the Scriptures made up a regular part of early Christian worship. Ferguson notes that the church developed a lectionary, or schedule of readings, early on, following the practice of the synagogue. Further, ancient literacy rates and the expense of books meant that “the principal opportunity for most Christians to become acquainted with the Scriptures was through hearing them read in church. Therefore, the regular, consecutive readings of the Bible occupied a principal place in the service” (Ferguson 85). Christians could expect that they would hear multiple readings from the Hebrew Bible and New Testament within the assembly as early as the second and third centuries.

These readings were not simply educative, though building familiarity with the Scriptures was not unimportant. Rather, they were understood as the very words of God spoken to the congregation, as stressed by Hippolytus of Rome, who baldly asserts that “it is God whom \[the believer\] hears speaking by the mouth of him who instructs” (*Apostolic Tradition,* 35, qtd. in Ferguson 68). Similarly, Tertullian notes about preaching that “judgment is administered with great authority, as among those in the presence of God” (*Apology* 39.105, qtd. in Ferguson 80). The spoken word of God here is assigned the authority of God himself, and worshippers come to hear it as if hearing God himself speak. The reading and preaching of Scripture in early worship thus serves not just to communicate information or bond a group in solidarity, but to draw the worshippers closer to the source of the words, God himself. By hearing what they believed to be the voice of God, the believers were drawn near to him, brought into his presence. Walter Ong has famously argued for a close connection between hearing and a sense of presence: “When we speak of a presence in its fullest sense—the presence which we experience in the case of another human being, which another person exercises on us and which no object or living being less than human can exercise—we speak of something that surrounds us, in which we are situated. ‘I am in his presence,’ we say, not ‘in front of his presence’” (130). The oral reading of the word of God served in much this way for early Christians to enhance their sense of the presence of God. The lector who reads the text with authority becomes for the believers the representative of God, and his voice stands in for God’s presence—not in order to build up the power and authority of the lector, but to present the assembly again with the experience of hearing God address them.

Person-giving continues to be linked to the reading and preaching of the Scriptures throughout Christian history, as we will see throughout this chapter. That linkage was present from the beginning, as seen in early Christian practices as well as in how they talk about those practices.

#### The Eucharist and the Christian Social Imaginary

Finally, early Christian worship can be closely linked to the development of what Taylor terms a “social imaginary,” that is, “the way ordinary people ‘imagine’ their social surroundings, [which] is often not expressed in theoretical terms, \[but\] is carried in images, stories, legends, etc.” (*SA* 171) and “that common understanding which makes possible common practices” (*SA* 172). A social imaginary thus is an *imaginative* (not theoretical) vision of the good life, an intuitive sense of the desirability of certain forms of communal living that can support a group’s efforts to create a life together. To a large extent, as Taylor understands it, any group of people who share a culture and worship together will share a social imaginary simply by virtue of their cultural proximity. However, the rhetorical force of early Christian worship comes through in the degree to which it deliberately attempts to shape this social imaginary for the believers, providing them with imaginative touchstones to help them forge a common life separate from the shared structures of their secular lives. We can see this imaginative fodder in the richly symbolic acts of the sacraments, most notably the Eucharist.

Ferguson notes that participation in the Eucharist had pride of place in the early Christian gathering. It “was the climax of the Christian worship service and that which distinguished it from the Jewish synagogue service” (94). The regular Sunday service centered around the Eucharist from at least the second century onward. Preceded by the liturgy of the Word and the Eucharistic prayer, the rite involved common consumption of ordinary bread and wine mixed with water, in imitation of the Last Supper depicted in the Synoptic Gospels (Matthew 26, Mark 14, and Luke 22). Ferguson notes that participation in the Eucharist implied “thanksgiving for God’s gifts” (hence the Greek term *Eucharist,* simply meaning “thanksgiving”) (105), consecration of these gifts as “a memorial of Christ,” and reception of the spiritual benefits of Jesus’ passion (107). Believers thus understood themselves to encounter Christ in a visceral way in the rite. The Eucharist also carried with it other associated rituals, most notably the exchange of a kiss, which Ferguson sees as expressing “fellowship, mutual love, and peace within the community” (98). Furthermore, in its earliest celebration the Eucharist was often “set in the context of a social meal” (Ferguson 97). Just as Jesus instituted the celebration in the context of the ritual meal of Passover (see Luke 22), early Christians often shared a common meal on Sunday, with the Eucharist as part of this fellowship (Ferguson 97). In the second century, the two rites grew apart, so that Christians frequently came together for the Eucharist in the morning, then re-convened for the fellowship meal or “love feast” in the afternoon or early evening (Ferguson 129). The rite of the Eucharist thus was associated in early Christian worship not just with participation in and memorialization of the body of blood of Christ, but with membership and peace in the community.

The rite of the Eucharist thus served as an imaginative, symbolic resource and thoroughgoing rhetorical system for Christians in their attempts to live in imitation of Christ and in love of their community. Ferguson notes that “the standard attained in Christian living in the second century was notable and contrasted sharply with the standard of conduct current in the pagan world” (193-94). Christians were expected to turn away from participation in many of the public rituals of the Roman Empire, especially spectacles such as gladiator shows which carried with them great violence and cruelty (Ferguson 195). They were expected to share their goods with those in need, as Hermas exhorted them: “Do not take an excessive share of God’s created things for yourself, but share with those who lack” (*Visions,* qtd. in Ferguson 205). Other moral demands included sexual restraint, love of enemies, and respect for the law (Ferguson 198). In particular, believers were expected to treat each other as brothers and sisters and live at peace within their own community, as seen by Saint Paul’s exhortation that Christians should not take their disputes to secular courts in 1 Corinthians 6, a passage which also speaks of illicit sexuality as damaging to the community. For Christians who had to meet such high demands of peace and concord within their community, a weekly gathering with a shared meal and a formal kiss served not just as a reminder to live at peace with one another, but a resource for building a social imaginary that would support the common practices of the moral life. The ritual prayers and participation in Christ of the Eucharist served as a counter-rite to the pervasive rituals of Roman life, offering believers an alternative to the public rituals of the Empire. The common meal modeled the just sharing of goods, allowing a direct mechanism for believers with greater wealth to share with those in need. And the exchange of peace provided the form for how Christians ought to conduct themselves with their fellow believers, in charity and accord. The Eucharist and its associated rituals thus were designed to inform Christian living on an imaginative level through symbolic and bodily resources, supporting a radical shift in the Christian’s way of life.

Undoubtedly Christians failed to live up to these moral ideals; the records of the early church contain abundant indication of unfaithfulness, injustice, and immorality. However, we ought simply here to note that the transformation of life sought by early Christian teachings was not carried out simply through doctrines and sermons and the linguistic sources of rhetorical effect that a conventional perspective on rhetoric would apprise. Instead, the early church operated using symbolic, ritual, and bodily forms of persuasion linking together an orientation toward a common perspective, a person-giving encounter with God, and the formation of a distinctly Christian social imaginary. Any study of the history of sacred rhetoric must draw upon an understanding of these rhetorical techniques within liturgical practice, for as this study will show, they continue to inform sacred rhetoricians up to the present day, allowing sacred rhetoric to fulfill its unique place in the interplay between religion, rhetoric, and philosophy. Rather than manifesting a concern with *either* emotion *or* truth—and thus falling into the terms of the conventional binary—the worship of the early church works to shape Christians in belief and habit, mind and body. It thus stands at the head of a sacred rhetorical tradition that stands outside the traditional conflict of secular rhetoric and philosophy, offering a distinctly holistic rhetorical framework.

### Early Christian Rhetoricians

If the history of rhetoric ought to look at early Christian worship, it ought also to consider early figures shaped by the rhetoric of worship. Many of the most influential early Christian thinkers were in fact trained as rhetoricians, from Ambrose and Jerome to Augustine and Gregory, and their rhetorical training influenced their leadership of the first Christian churches. Yet IJsseling and Bizzell and Herzberg alike limit their inclusion of these early figures to Augustine alone. IJsseling touches briefly on Jerome and turns to Augustine for the remainder of his discussion, integrating him fully into the conflict between rhetoric and philosophy, which he describes as “here even more evident than Plato” (42). For IJsseling, Augustine represents the attitudes of early Christians broadly, and those attitudes reflect a view of rhetoric as at best a neutral, content-free tool that serves the philosophical truth-claims of Christianity. He claims that “Augustine was primarily a philosopher rather than a rhetorician” (45). Similarly, Bizzell and Herzberg claim that early Christians saw “rhetoric as part of the hated Greco-Roman culture, imbued with . . . hopeless moral corruption” (8). On this account, early Christian writers have little to offer the history of rhetoric because, like Plato, they generally scorned it and subordinated it to the philosophical system of Christianity.

If religion is a source for rhetorical invention and not just philosophical epistemology, however, we will find much more of value for the history of rhetoric in the early Christian church. Augustine himself, from the position of a speculative sacred rhetoric, proves to be a surprisingly rhetorical figure, and other early Christians also have much to add to the tradition. Far from scorning rhetoric as such, early Christians forged their own distinctively Christian rhetoric, one that informs and resonates with the sacred rhetoric I have set out thus far in this dissertation. These pivotal thinkers deserve re-consideration and a place in the rhetorical tradition. Accordingly, in this section of my counter-history, I will re-examine Augustine, revealing a person-giving sacred rhetoric in his work that has great influence on the later tradition. In the spirit of expanding consideration of early Christian thought, I will also provide a brief treatment of another critical rhetorical thinker, Gregory the Great, who responds to Augustine and expands his project in some ways. This discussion should offer a starting point for a more thorough rhetorical consideration of early Christianity by other scholars, as well as informing my consideration of later thinkers working under the influence of Church Fathers like Augustine and Gregory.

Although we might find many locations for rhetorical understanding of Augustine, including his *Confessions* and his theological works, for the purposes of this brief discussion I will focus upon his most explicitly rhetorical work: *De doctrina Christiana,* or *On Christian Teaching* (hereafter *DDC*), a treatise on how Christian preachers ought to interpret and expound the Scriptures. Augustine’s rhetoric is distinctive in no small part for his heavy emphasis upon *ethos.* For Augustine, the example of the rhetor’s life is his best rhetorical tool, since the Christian preacher must be holy. After a discussion of the three levels of style (grand, middle, and plain), Augustine asserts: “More important than any amount of grandeur of style to those of us who seek to be listened to with obedience is the life of the speaker” (IV.151, p. 142). This argument for the absolute priority of ethos derives from a Christian call to holiness, but it also assumes a picture of the orator in line with Cicero’s. Cicero’s dialogue *On the Ideal Orator* (*De oratore*) is the fullest exploration of rhetorical theory by the great Roman, and, according to John O. Ward, the most significant influence on the *DDC.*[^47] Its very title, with its emphasis not upon a rhetorical skill but upon the person of the orator himself, suggests the ethotic (ethos-centered) nature of Cicero’s rhetoric. Throughout the work, Cicero develops a notion of the orator as one who “‘is on his own ground wherever he chooses to stand,’” a phrase he puts in the mouth of his esteemed mentor Crassus (III.125, p. 261). In contrast with Aristotle’s rhetoric, which depends much more heavily upon reasoning and *logos,* Cicero stresses the orator as an authoritative and persuasive figure whose persuasive powers rely on his character as much as his reasoning. Augustine intensifies the Ciceronian view of ethos further with the assertion that “people do not listen with obedience to the man who does not listen to himself” (*DDC,* IV.153, p. 143). Like Cicero, again, Augustine makes ethos a matter of actual virtue, not a mere piety of appearances. Although recognizing that some speakers may be able to communicate sound doctrine while living badly, ultimately Augustine places great faith in the ability of the audience to examine the ethos of the preacher. He thus claims that the preacher’s good life is his most powerful persuasive tool.

For Augustine, seeking the good of the audience is an absolute imperative for the preacher, the source and goal of all preaching, and indeed, all biblical interpretation. The Preface and Book One of *DDC* are full of the language of love, “which ties people together in the bonds of unity, to make souls overflow and as it were intermingle with each other” (Preface.13 pp. 7, 9). Following the teaching of the New Testament that Christians should be united (see John 17:21), Augustine insists upon love as the governing ethic for the Christian preacher. It is more than passing affection, but an emotion that unites one believer’s soul with another, much as Christian marriage is said to make one body of two people (see Mark 10:8). Building up this love within the church—both among the congregation, and between preacher and congregation—is among the primary tasks of the preacher, if not the most important one.[^48]

Augustine’s account of the audience thus has limited precedent in Cicero or his other classical sources.[^49] Cicero evinces little explicit concern for the audience in either *De oratore* or *De inventione,* and what discussion of the audience he provides shows his notion to be the furthest thing from an influence on Augustine. In the dialogue *De oratore* Cicero’s characters Crassus and Antonius consider holding the attention of the audience and delighting them, but without a sense that these tasks aim at anything other than persuasive effectiveness (III.97, p. 253). Their debate over how to speak about Greek philosophy also demonstrates only a concern with how to “carry more authority” with the audience (II.4, p. 126). Similarly, in *DI,* Cicero touches on how the orator can “work his way into the good graces of his hearers” through redirection of attention, brevity, and entertainment (XVII). This is hardly building up love between orator and audience. Cicero’s understanding of audience thus focuses upon how the rhetorician can turn them to his ends through authority or pleasing speech, not upon how to create love or serve the good of the audience.

In contrast, according to Murphy, Augustine believes that “rhetors do not persuade, but that hearers move themselves; that teachers do not teach, but instead that learners learn” (289). In short, with *DDC* Augustine joins an intensified Ciceronian doctrine of ethos to a dramatically interactive, powerful notion of the audience. Working from a wide knowledge of Cicero’s works, Augustine transforms the Ciceronian tradition into something better suited to the preaching task, with its Christian requirements of holiness, mutual charity, personal revelation through confession, and community life centered around the sacraments. Augustine is thus very far from scorning rhetoric and aligning himself with philosophy, as historians have alleged. Rather, he fuses the rhetorical tradition to specifically Christian ideas about love and community.

Similarly, Gregory the Great’s preaching theory expands upon rhetorical doctrines rather than dismissing them. This theory can largely be found in his influential treatise *The Book of Pastoral Rule* (*Cura pastoralis,* hereafter *CP*). Gregory occupies a position somewhat further from Cicero than Augustine, both intellectually and chronologically. *CP* draws from both Augustine’s Ciceronian *DDC* and Ambrose’s *On the Duties of the Clergy* (*De officiis ministrorum*), which was modeled on Cicero’s *De officiis.* However, Gregory does not cite Cicero directly. According to John Moorhead, he demonstrates much less connection to the classical tradition than Augustine; however, “elements of that tradition were known to him, with which he was able to assert a relationship in a playful style and which he could appropriate with elegance” (266). Moorhead argues that in Gregory’s time pagan antiquity had receded far enough into the past, both culturally and intellectually, that it did not demand a response from him in the same sense that it did from Augustine. Nonetheless, we can see the Ciceronian tradition showing up in *CP* as changed by Augustine. Far from supporting a diminishment of rhetoric, as Kennedy argues, Gregory in *CP* furthers Augustine’s transformation of the Ciceronian tradition.

Though Gregory does not allude directly to Cicero or Augustine—and Moorhead notes that he tends to be circumspect about citations (259)—he follows along readily with their view of ethos in his treatment of the preacher. For Gregory, “every preacher should be ‘heard’ more by his deeds than by his words. Moreover the footprint of his good living should be that path that others follow rather than the sound of his voice showing them where to go” (206-7). Like Augustine, Gregory here describes the preacher’s personal holiness in terms of its persuasive power, stressing that only one who lives well can be an effective priest. Furthermore, like Augustine, Gregory removes ethos from the realm of spoken language and embeds it in sight: rather than merely hearing what the preacher says, the audience must be taught to follow where he leads. This parallels Augustine’s claim that the preacher “should choose to satisfy his audience with things rather than words,” that is, with the example of his life rather than his rhetoric (*DDC* IV.61.155, p. 143). This emphasis on virtue is a modified version of the ethotic tradition of Cicero and Quintilian, but is recognizable within it and its discussion by Augustine.

Gregory’s approach to audience similarly partakes of Augustine’s, yet if anything he furthers the theory’s distance from Cicero. Unlike *DDC,* *CP* is not primarily a treatise on preaching, though later works frequently cite it as such, and Gregory does touch on the subject. Instead, Gregory’s primary concern is with spiritual direction, a more private, individual relationship between the priest and a single Christian. When Gregory turns to public preaching, he retains this highly individualized concern for the audience: “the discourse of the teacher should be adapted to the character of his audience so that it can address the specific needs of each individual and yet never shrink from the art of communal edification” (87). Gregory would thus have the preacher prepare not merely to win over or impress the audience as a group, but to address the particular needs of individuals.

Gregory reinforces this practice of attention to individual congregants in Part III of *CP,* in which he discusses thirty-six pairs of human types and offers counsel on how the preacher should approach them for their spiritual benefit. These include relatively fixed categories such as men and women or the young and the old, but also those that could fluctuate, including the bold and the timid, the healthy and the sick, the sincere and the insincere, and the deliberately sinning and the accidentally sinning. For each pair, Gregory offers advice similar to this comment about the sad and the joyful: “Before the joyful are to be set the sad things that accompany (eternal) punishment, but before the sad the joyous promises of the kingdom should be set” (93). Gregory thus advises the preacher to tailor his message to the needs of particular audience members, to lift them out of sadness or caution them against overconfidence. He describes this practice as “combat\[ting\] the spiritual illnesses of each person with the appropriate remedies” (202). For Gregory, then, the preacher acts as a healer of ills even more than one who persuades an audience.

George E. Demacopoulos calls this catalogue of human types the “most original” part of *CP* (211), noting that although Gregory of Nazianzen suggests a similar practice in his *Oration,* Gregory the Great’s analysis is much fuller and richer (217). For Demacopoulos, this spirit of service reflects Gregory’s greatest contribution to the practice of the priesthood and episcopal leadership: his fusion of the spirit of monasticism, or the contemplative life, to the active life of the bishop. Demacopoulos argues that Gregory’s notion of “spiritual authority” derives from the monastic virtues of discretion and contemplation, which center upon careful reflection upon the spiritual struggles of the individual (214). Rather than merely seeking to change the direction of a group through persuasion centered on ideas or group bonding, monastic spirituality stresses the particular spiritual needs of individuals. Gregory’s contribution to the preaching tradition thus must be understood not only as furthering the Augustinian understanding of *ethos,* derived from Cicero, but as deepening the theory of audience through joining it to monastic spirituality, encouraging the preacher to be attentive to individual audience members. Early Christian monasticism enjoined the monk to retreat from the world, stressing asceticism and feats of renunciation such as “sleeping on the floor, going barefoot, extreme fasting, and abstaining completely from wine” as well as celibacy and disciplines of daily prayer (Goehring). These ascetic practices were aimed at “fashion\[ing\] a new self defined in terms of radical Christian spirituality” (Goehring). Monks attempted to reduce their attachment to pleasure and comfort in order to increase their desire for God and to become like his passionless and perfect angels. Though Gregory’s work makes no attempt to lay this burden of asceticism upon his lay audience, he is clearly influenced by the monastic stress upon personal transformation aimed at participation in the divine life. Rather than merely aiming to sway the audience in order to enlist them in the preacher’s project, he seeks their individual spiritual good.

In their emphasis upon ethos and the spiritual good of the audience, both Augustine and Gregory resonate deeply with the person-giving word of Scripture as practiced in early worship. The preaching of the Scriptures served to present God to the congregation (as in the discussion of the early church), and also to build up love between the preacher and the congregation themselves. In this manner, Augustine’s and Gregory’s theories of preaching stressed the person-giving Latour identifies in religious speech, properly understood. Additionally, their theories of preaching were to serve as major influences upon later medieval preaching theory, discussed as an exemplar of person-giving rhetoric in my analysis of Latour (see chapter 3). Augustine and Gregory ought thus to be understood as vital sources for the person-giving tendencies of Christian rhetorical tradition.

### Administrative Religious Rhetoric

With medieval rhetoric discussed both in my account of Augustine and Gregory and my chapter on Latour, I now turn to the early modern period. I propose that George Herbert’s *The Country Parson* may be read as an exceptionally subtle and powerful addition to the tradition of sacred rhetoric. Herbert’s work has not traditionally been understood as a contribution to the rhetorical tradition—although several critics have found rhetorical affordances in Herbert’s poetry (with varying results), his prescriptive work on preaching and ministry has not been taken up by rhetoricians. Yet Herbert merits inclusion in the rhetorical tradition on the basis of his unique and compelling rhetoric for the minister, a rhetoric which combines Augustinian preaching theory with what Burke calls an “administrative” rhetoric, all in service of a person-giving theory of religion.

Though Herbert is well known as a poet, his handbook for ministers, *The Country Parson,* has not been studied as a contribution to the rhetorical tradition. The book combines elements of the courtesy book (e.g., Baldesar Castiglione’s *Book of the Courtier*; see Wolberg, 14) with consideration of preaching and other persuasive actions that ought to be taken by the priest serving a country parish. In his note to the reader, Herbert states that he aims “to set down the Form and Character of a true Pastor, that I may have a Mark to aim at: which also I will set as high as I can, since he shoots higher that threatens the Moon, than he that aims at a Tree” (54). His task, then, is to develop a descriptive treatment of the ideal pastor in order to orient pastoral practice towards excellence. This descriptive focus on an idealized figure sets *The Country Parson* within the “ideal orator” tradition of rhetorical treatises, a tradition initiated by Cicero’s *De Oratore* (the title of which James M. May and Jakob Wisse translate as *On the Ideal Orator*) and receiving another famous treatment in book 12 of *The Orator’s Education* with the notion of the “vir bonus dicendi peritus,” the good man speaking well (Quintilian 12.1.1). Prior to serving as a country parson, Herbert labored as professor of rhetoric at Cambridge, ultimately ascending to the role of public orator for the college. He thus was well acquainted with rhetorical thought, and *The Country Parson* draws on the tradition in multiple ways, as we will see.

Despite Herbert’s rhetorical qualities and his importance as a literary figure, *The Country Parson* has not been included in the canon of rhetorical theory, nor has it been discussed by scholars of rhetoric. In their treatment of the early modern period, IJsseling, Bizzell and Herzberg stress instead Frances Bacon and the Italian humanists (IJsseling 54-61) or Erasmus, Castiglione, Ramus, and Scudéry (Bizzell and Herzberg 581-681, 761-779). Of the works Bizzell and Herzberg include, only Erasmus’ *Ecclesiastes* could be described as a sacred rhetoric (628-50), while IJsseling provides a brief discussion of Jesuit rhetoric and sacred aspects of Giambattista Vico’s thought (56-58). The sacred rhetoricians Shuger covers, such as Juan Luis Vives, go unmentioned, as does (more critically for my purposes) Herbert.

We do have one rhetorical understanding of *The Country Parson* in a 1999 article by Stanley Fish, yet ultimately his work too limits the rhetorical value of the text. For Fish, Herbert’s ideal parson is the consummate rhetor: “He is never himself alone; he is always in the act of composing himself, that is, of putting together or constructing the role he will then play” (39). Herbert’s parson is always *acting out* his duty, rhetorically constructing his ethos, in order to lead others to a similar rhetorical construction of themselves. The parson must “struggle for insincerity,” as Fish’s title has it. Fish grants that his thoroughly rhetorical treatment of *The Country Parson* “could be read as a severe criticism of Herbert, indeed as an accusation of hypocrisy,” yet he claims that this insincerity in fact reflects Herbert’s Christian desire for “self-immolation” (40). That is, “\[w\]hat Herbert sees is that, in relation to the mode of life for which the Christian yearns—a reunion with the will of God—sincerity, the claim of saying and doing what you mean, is the greatest temptation” (41). In Fish’s reading, Herbert’s Christian faith is predicated upon the destruction of the natural self in order to replace it with one dedicated wholly to the service of God. On Fish’s understanding of Herbert, the parson should flee authenticity and sincerity in the self—his goal is not an authentic self, but a Christian one in dialogue with his parishioners. Fish’s understanding of *The Country Parson* thus foregrounds the rhetorical construction of the parson’s self, understanding it as a manual for creating a thoroughgoing pastoral ethos. Insofar as Fish rhetoricizes Herbert’s Christian faith, his work presents a valuable starting point for integrating *The Country Parson* into the rhetorical tradition. Unfortunately, Fish extends the argument to a moral critique of this rhetorical aspect of Herbert’s work, and in so doing he badly damages the usefulness of his analysis. As he explores how Herbert describes the pastor relating to his parishioners, Fish sees the pastor as engaging in a kind of Foucauldian Panoptic surveillance, exercising disciplinary control over his parishioners (44). They are in a relationship of “dependence and manipulation” to him due to his pastoral oversight of them, which includes watching out for their failings and seeking to correct them (47). Ultimately, though Fish disclaims any desire to engage in a moral critique of Herbert’s rhetoricity, he concludes his piece with a focus on “the darkness and terror of Herbert’s vision,” seeing the parson’s oversight of his flock as a sinister attempt at control over them (47). Rejecting “the piety that has always characterized Herbert studies,” he insists on seeing Herbert’s articulation of his duties—his denial of self—as imbued with an obsession with power and control (50). It is hard to see this as anything less than a moral attack on Herbert’s position. Fish thus cedes ground to the old critique that a thoroughgoing rhetoric can only be pernicious. He remains comfortable with Herbert’s rhetoricity insofar as it shapes the pastor’s own attitudes, but when it extends to persuasive work—which is after all the traditional goal of rhetoric—he pulls back. For Herbert to seek to persuade and admonish his parishioners, apparently, leaves him open for Fish to a charge of surveillance and manipulation. Ultimately, then, Fish’s work represents an insufficiently robust rhetoric of *The Country Parson* insofar as it engages in a moral critique of Herbert’s rhetoric as rhetoric.

In contrast, I will demonstrate that *The Country Parson* can be found to enact a thoroughgoing rhetoricity, in which the shaping force of rhetoric is seen as neither sinister nor coercive, but only human, consistent with the rhetorical work we find throughout the tradition. However, in order to argue for such an expansive notion of Herbert’s rhetoric, it is important to consider Helen Wilcox’s claim that Herbert himself may have had some reservations about rhetoric—and as such could be understood as acquiescing to Fish’s critique. Wilcox points out that some of Herbert’s poetry can be read as evincing a “poetic distrust” of rhetoric, with its excessive showiness and “enchanting” power (59). Yet Wilcox argues that Herbert resolves his background in oratory and later distrust of the subject by understanding Jesus Christ as the ultimate orator, and the Bible as “a potential source of inspiration for rhetorical modes and models of oration” (60). Herbert’s concerns about rhetoric in a religious context thus end in a sanctification of the subject by taking divine inspiration as its source. In questioning rhetoric’s value and resolving it through an appeal to the Bible as model, Herbert identifies himself with Augustine’s resolution of the same problem in *DDC*. Understanding the parallels between *The Country Parson* and *DDC*, both in how the two books handle concerns about rhetoric and how they envision the preacher, allows us to begin articulating the full scope of Herbert’s sacred rhetoric.

Herbert’s resolution of the problem of rhetoric, as Wilcox understands it, looks very much like how Augustine deals with the same problem. Augustine, too, expresses ambivalence about rhetoric at some points. Book IV of *DDC* is the section of his work most commonly discussed as part of the rhetorical tradition (for instance, it is anthologized by Bizzell and Herzberg), yet Augustine begins the book by disclaiming its connection to rhetoric, stating that whoever wants to learn rhetorical tricks can learn them elsewhere (IV.1-2). Augustine thus distances himself from both classical rhetoric and the sophists of his own day, as Christine Mason Sutherland has pointed out (1-2). And we might read Augustine, as Sutherland does, to be displaying a basic suspicion of rhetoric as a neutral tool which can be turned to good or evil ends, a tool which the Christian must learn only so that the enemy does not gain “a dangerous advantage” through its pernicious use (Sutherland 1). However, Augustine ultimately sanctifies rhetoric with the same move employed by Herbert in *The Country Parson*—grounding rhetoric in a divine source—suggesting that Herbert possesses a conscious or unconscious debt to *DDC* for his rhetorical theory. In *DDC* III.38.85, Augustine characterizes Scripture as having eloquence (*eloquiis*), one of the terms that characterizes rhetoric in Book Four (see IV.27.74, for example). For Augustine, the preacher’s task is to expound the Bible. Insofar as his technique draws on the rhetoric of the Bible, his own rhetoric is sanctified. Ultimately, then, for both Augustine and Herbert the rhetoric of the preacher is above reproach insofar as it draws on Scripture.

The comparison between *The Country Parson* and *DDC* grows stronger when we look at how each treats the rhetorical moves characteristic of the preacher. Both Augustine and Herbert advocate a rhetoric for the preacher which relies heavily on the preacher’s ethos as expressed through the totality of his Christian life. Herbert spends a good portion of the early part of his text focused on the parson’s lifestyle, stating in his definition of the pastor that “a Priest is to do that which Christ did, and after this manner, both for Doctrine and Life” (55). Only after taking up the parson as “exceeding exact in his Life” does Herbert proceed to his more overtly rhetorical work as a preacher and minister (56). In this structure, Herbert illustrates the link between the preacher’s life and his rhetorical effectiveness summarized so aptly in his well-known poem “The Windows”:

> Doctrine and life, colors and light, in one    
> When they combine and mingle, bring    
> A strong regard and awe: but speech alone    
> Doth vanish like a flaring thing,    
> And in the ear, not conscience ring. (183-84)

Although Wilcox reads this passage as demonstrating a suspicion of rhetoric *per se,* we might just as easily understand it as advocating a certain *kind* of rhetoric, in which the preacher’s true effectiveness depends upon the thoroughly rhetorical concept of ethos. Producing “a strong regard and awe,” after all, is a rhetorical effect, and it is one created, in Herbert’s estimation, by a rhetoric which includes the preacher’s own life, his full-bodied ethos. Herbert need not be read her as disavowing rhetoric, his area of expertise, but rather as emphasizing the ethotic quality of preaching.

Similarly, Augustine argues that when possible the preacher “should choose to satisfy his audience with things rather than words,” that is, with the example of his life rather than his rhetoric (IV.61.155). This is a highly expansive notion of ethos, which shifts the appeal from covering merely how the preacher presents himself to an audience in a speech situation, to the whole of the preacher’s life. Without a whole life constructed rhetorically to be appealing and Christlike, Augustine and Herbert say, the preacher cannot be rhetorically effective. As we have already seen in my previous discussion of Augustine, Gregory, and the medieval rhetoricians, this position is essentially a commonplace in the homiletic tradition.

A final point of contact between *The Country Parson* and *DDC* can be found in their treatment of audience. Augustine insists that the preacher’s task is to “build up [the] double love of God and neighbour,” and in so doing to help his audience toward their greater sanctification (I.40.86, p. 49). Furthermore, he insists that the preacher should not try to impress the audience with his perspicuity, but that he should restrict his exegesis to points that are accessible to the hearers (IV.23.63). Throughout DDC, Augustine’s emphasis remains on presenting an accessible, useful, and charity-building interpretation of Scripture through preaching.

Herbert’s description of the parson’s relationships to his congregation bears this same Augustinian emphasis on doing service to the audience. For Herbert, it is incumbent upon the parson to draw illustrations and examples from the rural world of his parishioners: the parson “condescends even to the knowledge of tillage, and pastorage, and makes great use of them in teaching, because people by what they understand, are best led to what they understand not” (58). Sermons in a rural church thus ought to draw on the rural context for their examples and illustrations. They should not be an opportunity for the preacher to show his academic prowess, but should reflect the concerns of the audience. For Herbert, as for Augustine, the preacher must take care to make himself understood before he shows off his learning. Moreover, Herbert gives much of his treatise over to how the parson should concern himself directly with the lives of his flock through such actions as hospitality (Chapter XI) and giving alms (Chapter XII). He explicitly ties such activities to preaching in his catalogue of what the parson is to do on Sundays: after leading the church service, he is to spend the remainder of Sunday “either in reconciling neighbors that are at variance, or in visiting the sick, or in exhortations to some of his flock by themselves, whom his Sermons cannot, or do not reach” (65). The preacher’s rhetoric thus extends to his actions outside the divine service, and encompasses actions of reconciliation or outreach to the parish at large. As for Augustine, for Herbert the preacher should not seek to sway his audience for his own benefit, but should instead attempt to do them good both through speech and action, with all of these aspects of his life and ministry working in conjunction. The Augustinian rhetoric employed by Herbert bases its language and theology in a concern for the persons and lives of the preacher and the congregation.

We might take this analysis further by adopting a concept from Burke’s work on secular rhetoric: the notion of an “administrative rhetoric” which accomplishes its persuasive goals not just through language, but through material action. Considering Herbert’s treatise only in relation to Augustine might leave us with the idea that Herbert’s concern with the personal is only to draw on embodied life to create persuasive power in the sermon or testimony—pastoral concern as sermon material. Such an approach would not ultimately escape the problems of Burke’s excessively linguistic rhetoric of religion, for it would merely accomplish a reduction of personal, bodily concerns to the linguistic. Moreover, if Herbert’s concern with the personal only existed to fuel discursive persuasion, his rhetoric could be easily understood by reference to Burke’s theories of transcendence, for his personal concerns might only be material to be placed within the transcendent structure of religious doctrine. Showing how Herbert adopts an administrative rhetoric, however, will demonstrate how his rhetoric’s treatment of personhood goes much further in tying itself to mundane and non-transcendent matters.

Burke employs the concept of “administrative rhetoric” in a discussion of Machiavelli, arguing that “The Prince can be treated as a rhetoric insofar as it deals with the producing of effects upon an audience” (*Rhetoric of Motives,* 158). For Burke, Machiavelli’s Prince goes through various efforts to produce a certain impression upon his subjects or his fellow princes, and since these efforts—no matter how little they look like oratory—have a persuasive purpose, they can be understood as rhetorical. In Burke’s administrative rhetoric, “the persuasion cannot be confined to the strictly verbal; it is a mixture of symbolism and definite empirical operations” (*Rhetoric of Motives,* 161). The Prince’s rhetorical efforts may well include speeches, but they may also include wars, negotiations, patronages—since for Machiavelli, all these actions have the effect of building up the Prince’s persuasive powers. Unfortunately, Burke never extends this concept of nonverbal, administrative rhetoric to religion, yet Herbert shows that sacred rhetoric need not be verbal and may well be administrative.

Analyzing Herbert’s description of the parson’s concern for his congregation has already provided some idea of the administrative concerns of his rhetoric, yet we can go further. Herbert’s treatise presents numerous ways for the parson to turn nonverbal things to his rhetorical advantage in appealing to his congregation. His marital status must depend upon “the temper of his Parish,” such that he will seek out a wife if “he may have occasion to converse with women, and that among suspicious men” (66). Even the parson’s body is thus governed by the imperative to appeal to the flock, as he should not enter into a romantic relationship without considering his flock. Herbert follows this discussion of the pastor’s romantic affairs with a discussion of the pastor’s household, which is among the longer chapters in the book. In this chapter he describes not only how the pastor should observe his religion at home, but how he should be thrifty, what kinds of food he ought to eat, and how he ought to care for his health. All of the household is to serve his vocation as a minister: he says of the parson’s family and servants that “in the house of a Preacher, all are preachers” (69). His wife and family ought to support his ministry and he is responsible for giving them religious education; so, too, with his servants, “so that his family is a School of Religion” (69). Nonhuman objects have a prominent place in this chapter: Herbert talks about money (charitable giving should not be seen as depriving his children); gardens and orchards (essential for the parson’s budget); “crumbs, and scattered corn” (good for feeding poultry and swine, p. 70); “rheum” and phlegm (arising from fasting mishandled); beer, fish, roots, and bitter herbs (good for the stomach). The parson’s persuasive work thus involves him in mundane matters of household management, which are by no means below his notice, but serve a vital role in his ministry. Herbert’s insistence that even the nonhuman preaches on the parson’s behalf extends even to this compelling bit of anthropomorphism: “Even the walls are not idle, but something is written, or painted there, which may excite the reader to a thought of piety,” such as the text of Psalm 101 (69). The pastor’s body and all the bodies of his household—human and nonhuman—thus all contribute to an administrative rhetoric aimed at building up his flock.

Herbert’s administrative rhetoric for the parson extends as well from the parson’s household to his action throughout the parish, as the parson is admonished to visit his parishioners regularly, provide services to them and support the local order. These actions are to be taken in order to produce pastoral effects among his parishioners, that he may bless, admonish, commend, instruct and guide for “higher purposes” (77). An administrative rhetoric, the production of effects through physical action, thus makes up no small part of the parson’s work. These administrative efforts are the elements of Herbert’s treatise which Fish finds so chilling, redolent of a “dependence and manipulation that everyone is forced to enact” (“‘Void of Storie’,” 17). Yet however little Fish or any modern reader may agree with the admittedly socially conservative program of Herbert’s pastor, to turn from defending Herbert’s rhetorical selfhood to attacking the “manipulation” of his persuasive efforts seems disingenuous. The parish priest in Herbert’s time by no means held any absolute authority to exercise physical or legal force among his flock: even if, as Cooley points out, the clerical profession was emerging as an instrument of “social control,” its status remained very much contested (57). Therefore, we must understand Herbert’s administrative rhetoric precisely as a rhetoric, a technique of persuasion rather than compulsion, and as such no more or less problematic than the other elements of Herbert’s rhetorical theory.

A defense of Herbert’s administrative rhetoric is crucial to my project here—and thus merits my repeated harangue against Fish—since it gives me the best means to develop Herbert’s thought in contrast the second insufficiency in Burke’s rhetoric of religion. Whereas Burke reads all religious persuasion as structured by “complex theories of transcendence,” Herbert’s administrative rhetoric is much more mundane, yet still thoroughly religious (*RR,* 5). Though Herbert admittedly encourages the parson to strive after “higher purposes,” the structure of his rhetoric is entirely pragmatic and enmeshed with mundane objects (77). Even in his directions for the care of the church, Herbert’s directions read more like a training manual than an ecclesiology: the pastor should take care “that all things be in good repair; as walls plastered, windows glazed, floor paved, seats whole, firm, and uniform . . . . . Secondly, that the Church be swept, and kept clean without dust, or Cobwebs, and at great festivals strawed, and stuck with boughs, and perfumed with incense” (74). Herbert’s justification for this mundane list of physical duties is biblical, citing St. Paul in 1 Cor. 14, but also rhetorical, claiming that the cleanliness of the church is “for the benefit of our neighbor” (75).

Similarly, when Herbert advocates that the parson gain medical knowledge, he does so with a radically heterogeneous blend of theological and practical wisdom. He advises the parson to grow an herb garden, “wherein the manifold wisdom of God is wonderfully seen,” and which is also “more easy for the Parson’s purse” than purchasing drugs (88-89). In every part of Herbert’s rhetoric, then, religion is understood not simply through reference to a complex order of transcendence, but also with a mundane entanglement with bodies, objects and pragmatic action. Herbert’s rhetoric of religion is thus both transcendent and mundane, concerned with divine order and with the everyday life of the parish on its own terms.

In Herbert’s rhetorical theory he is clearly dedicated to the Latourian themes of presence, closeness, and transformation rather than the Burkean search for transcendence. Whether in his Augustinian focus on the personhood of the orator and audience or in his administrative concern for mundane objects and activities, Herbert’s rhetoric too participates in a sacred rhetoric which stresses persons and centers upon closeness with God, making person-giving an apt term here as well.

### Preaching in the Enlightenment

Enlightenment rhetoric becomes a key site for the secularization of rhetorical history, as well as the binary conflict between philosophy and rhetoric. Traditional histories of rhetoric associate the Enlightenment with the triumph of a secular philosophy over rhetoric, understanding the period as one featuring the return of a kind anti-rhetorical Platonism. IJsseling identifies the Enlightenment with Kant and aligns it with philosophy over against rhetoric, which is seen as “dangerous,” “no art,” and “ultimately unworthy of a human being” due to its trafficking in illusions and entertainment in order to turn the audience to the orator’s own ends (85). Bizzell and Herzberg also interpret the Enlightenment using the philosophy vs. rhetoric motif, as well as associated themes of science and literature. They see rhetoric in the Enlightenment as primarily a story of the discipline’s reaction to “the great ideas of the Enlightenment—empiricism, rationalism, and psychology” (812). Each of these “great ideas” is notably secular, championed by philosophers like Hume and Locke, whose work tends to deny or ignore the importance of the sacred. Sacred concerns like preaching and biblical interpretation play a role in the readings Bizzell and Herzberg excerpt from medieval and early modern rhetoric; moreover, their section on nineteenth-century rhetoric includes sermons by Phoebe Palmer and Frances Willard. Yet the Enlightenment would appear to be totally secular.

I am far from denying that the Enlightenment affected a radical change in the understanding of religion, yet to treat it as a secularized period is historically suspect. If we follow Taylor in seeing history not as a one-directional move toward the secular but as a multi-causal, “diachronic” process of change, then we can see the Enlightenment as a period both of great secularization and significant religious activity (*SS,* 204). Such a recovery of the Enlightenment in its complexity is made simple by the recognition that two of the signal figures of Enlightenment rhetoric—Hugh Blair and George Campbell—were also Christian ministers and teachers of ministers. Campbell’s work, in particular, shows no small concern for sacred rhetoric through his concern for the rhetorical task of preaching. Bizzell and Herzberg associate Campbell strongly with philosophy and science, describing his rhetoric as primarily concerned with reason over persuasion: “the real differences \[between philosophy and rhetoric\] lie only in subject matter. With this firm base in reason, rhetoric can confidently proceed through the steps toward persuasion” (808). For Bizzell and Herzberg, Campbell’s significance is primarily in his subordination of rhetoric to the epistemological work of philosophy and science. Rhetoric mainly exists to communicate the truths uncovered by these more fundamental disciplines, among which religion does not seem to rank. Bizzell and Herzberg thus treat Campbell as a philosophical thinker and give no consideration to the religious aspect of his work. Though I do not dissent from their understanding of his philosophical Enlightenment-era principles, it must be noted that Campbell dedicates not an insignificant section of *The Philosophy of Rhetoric* to a consideration of preaching. He also published a sermon he delivered entitled “The Character of a Minister of the Gospel as a Teacher and Pattern,” in which he offers principles on preaching to an audience of future ministers.[^50] By looking at these two key texts in the history of rhetoric, we can productively complicate our understanding of the Enlightenment and discover how sacred rhetoric shapes this period as well.

Read within the tradition of sacred rhetoric, Campbell appears as a member of the *ars praedicandi* tradition, an heir of medieval tradition, though admittedly one adding his own modern innovations. He draws extensively on previous views about the challenges of preaching and the necessity of a strong sense of ethos to the preacher, placing him squarely within the preaching tradition deriving from Augustine’s *DDC.* At the same time, he displays a confidence in the power of language and oratory itself—and a disdain for non-linguistic tools of persuasion in liturgy—that the earlier tradition, whether in the liturgical structures of the medieval church or Herbert’s code of conduct, seems to lack. In this perhaps we see the origin of the linguistic and doctrinal emphasis which rhetoricians themselves have displayed in their consideration of sacred rhetoric. Campbell’s work stands at the head of modern, academic reflections upon rhetoric: Bizzell and Herzberg term *The Philosophy of Rhetoric* “the first modern rhetoric” (901). Modern rhetoric’s neglect of non-linguistic aspects of rhetoric, up to and including the secularization of the field by Burke and others, thus might in some way by laid at Campbell’s feet. Of course, in Campbell this reduction itself comes from religious impulses. As a Scottish Presbyterian, his disdain for the liturgy arises not from epistemological principles drawn from modern philosophy, but instead from his radically Reformed, Protestant resistance to the traditions of Roman Catholicism. Campbell’s emphasis upon preaching and disdain for liturgy are utterly typical of Scottish Calvinism, which insists upon a radical commitment to simplicity in worship.[^51] Ironically, then, the secularization of the rhetorical tradition in modernity has its roots in a doctrinal dispute within the Christian church. Recognizing the religious origins in Campbell of our discomfort with sacred rhetoric thus should put us on firmer footing for integrating sacred rhetoric back into the rhetorical tradition.

Although Campbell addresses sacred rhetoric in a number of places throughout *The Philosophy of Rhetoric,* his most extended treatment comes within a section on the genres of modern oratory, in which preaching receives pride of place. He identifies three genres: legal, political, and religious, corresponding to the professions of the lawyer, the senator, and the minister (Golden and Corbett 226).[^52] Among these, Campbell insists that the preacher has “the most difficult task” (227). First, because “he hath a character to support, which is much more easily injured than that of either the senator, or the speaker at the bar” (227). Whereas lawyers and politicians will receive some amount of indulgence for their character provided they do their jobs well, the preacher has no such latitude. Second, Campbell argues that the audience for the sermon, at least in the context of “a populous and flourishing city, where there is a great variety in rank and education, [is] of all audiences the most promiscuous” (229). Whereas in Campbell’s time the audience for legal or political rhetoric would be largely male and upper-class, the Christian congregation offered a much more diverse gathering. Third, Campbell notes that where subject matter is concerned, though the preacher has material that is “infinitely more lofty and more affecting” (231) than the lawyer or the politician, by that same breadth the subject also lends itself less to provoking the passion of the audience (232). Whereas the lawyer or the politician can provoke the audience to disdain for concrete persons, the criminal or the political opponent, the preacher can only rail against vice in general. For that reason, he faces a greater challenge in arousing either spite or affection. Fourth, the occasion of the preacher’s performance offers more difficulties than the other practitioners, because whereas the jury or the parliamentary audience arrive prepared with some knowledge of the subject matter at hand, “men go to church without any of these advantages” (233). Church members have no prior knowledge of the subject of the sermon, nor do they necessarily arrive in a spirit of great curiosity to hear what the preacher will say. He must therefore find a way to create interest among those who may be present merely by habit. Fifth and finally, Campbell sees the goal of preaching as the most challenging to attain. Whereas legal and political rhetoric aim at limited, immediate purposes, “[t]he primary intention of preaching is the reformation of mankind” (234). For Campbell, the preacher aims at the transformation of his hearers’ lives, not just a momentary shift of opinion or will, and a transformation directed toward the good. Such a transformation is remarkably difficult to achieve, he claims, for whereas it “is not unprecedented that one should persuade a multitude, from mistaken motives of religion, to act the part of ruffians,” to persuade an audience “to be wise, and just, and good” almost never occurs (235). Considered across standard rhetorical topoi, then, Campbell sees sacred rhetoric as the most difficult and critical genre of speech.

Campbell’s treatment of sacred rhetoric follows the *ars praedicandi* tradition in several ways, and ultimately pursues a goal consistent with Latour’s person-giving speech. In the emphasis given to the centrality of ethos in the preacher’s task, Campbell aligns neatly with the *ars praedicandi* tradition from Augustine onward, as he insists that the minister must not only be skilled and a good speaker, but must live an unimpeachable life in order to preserve credibility with his congregation. Additionally, Campbell requires the preacher to modulate his style and material in order to serve the entire audience despite their diversity of preparation and experience, in an emphasis that follows the audience-focused rhetoric of preaching theorists like Gregory the Great. Finally, Campbell’s emphasis upon the transformation of the audience reflects a concern for person-giving, as his sacred rhetoric aims not at teaching doctrine or interpreting Scripture, but changing the will of the audience to be directed toward the right ends: “It is not an immediate and favorable suffrage, but a thorough change of heart and disposition” that the preacher aims at (234). This emphasis upon the task of the preacher as the most challenging and transformational form of rhetoric sets Campbell within the tradition of person-giving rhetoric, aligned with Augustine’s insistence upon a rhetoric of love, Gregory’s concern for spiritual direction, and Herbert’s pastoral rhetoric. Though *The Philosophy of Rhetoric* treats many other areas of rhetoric, then, the work still ought to be considered part of a tradition of sacred rhetoric and not merely an entry in the histories of philosophy and rhetoric.

Moreover, reading Campbell’s sermon “The Character of a Minister of the Gospel” offers further insight into his distinctive contributions to the tradition as a sacred rhetorician. The text, which has yet to receive a modern edition or treatment in histories of rhetoric, offers an extended consideration of the preacher’s role as Campbell discussed it for a meeting of the Synod of Aberdeen, a regional council of ministers within the Scottish Presbyterian church. Campbell preached the sermon in 1752, more than twenty years before he published *The Philosophy of Rhetoric,* while he was still a minister who had not yet embarked on an academic career (see Golden and Corbett 139). Though published as a freestanding text, the document retains sermonic conventions such as beginning with a passage of Scripture and concluding in prayer, as Campbell must have preached it to the Synod. Like Latour, then, when talking about the rhetoric of religion, Campbell seems to find it helpful to talk about it religiously. Though “The Character of a Minister” may not reflect Campbell’s most mature thoughts on sacred rhetoric, it nonetheless offers one of his more extended treatments and a unique instance in which he united reflection upon and practice of sacred rhetoric.

In the sermon, Campbell’s treatment of the preacher’s role diverges somewhat from his briefer discussion in *The Philosophy of Rhetoric,* and also offers further detail, highlighting some of Campbell’s innovations within the preaching tradition. In particular, relative to the material in *The Philosophy of Rhetoric,* Campbell de-emphasizes the role of the preacher’s ethos. His treatment instead begins with an emphasis upon “the minister of the gospel as *a public teacher*” (6).[^53] Campbell dedicates the first major section of the sermon to the importance of knowledge about religion and ethics for the preacher, insisting that instilling religious knowledge in the congregation is a fundamental part of his role. Indeed, Campbell claims, “*Knowledge* is truly the *ground-work* of every moral and spiritual attainment” (7). Whereas Campbell’s treatment in *The Philosophy of Rhetoric* tends toward positioning the preacher as a moral exemplar and vehicle for transformation of lives, in “The Character of a Minister,” he appears more as a source of doctrine and biblical knowledge. Though Campbell does not fail to discuss the value of ethos later in the sermon (e.g., in a discussion of the preacher as exemplar on p. 32), his treatment of the subject is comparatively brief and positioned at a less central place in the organization of the argument. Though he continues to emphasize that the goal of preaching “is the *reformation* of the hearers in heart and life,” in this instance he emphasizes the preacher’s teaching role over his role as exemplar (23). Whatever the reason for this shift—whether it reflects an earlier view or Campbell modulating his emphasis for a different audience—it demonstrates that thought on sacred rhetoric even within one Enlightenment thinker is not monolithic, but has varying points of emphasis.

Campbell’s discussion in “The Character of a Minister” also diverges notably from the prior tradition in its refusal to embed the sermon within a liturgical context. Campbell in fact opposes good preaching, which emphasizes moral lessons, to liturgical ceremony at several points. Early in the text, he sets ritual and ethics in opposition to one another: “When the attention of men is fixt upon idle *pageantry* and *rareeshow,*[^54] *the baptisms of cups and platters,* and the like endless and useless ceremonial *purgations* and *consecrations,* such *trifles* will quickly disposess *justice, mercy, veracity, the love of God* and *honour of parents*” (11). For Campbell, speaking to an audience of like-minded Scottish Presbyterians, the rituals of the historic Christian liturgy and a true faith in God are totally opposed, with the one tending toward superstition and idolatry and the other tending toward a true faith and ethical life. In this Campbell was consistent with the Scottish church, which rejected “[i]mages and statues, stained glass windows, relics, pilgrimages, the cult of the saints, special feasts and festivals, and indeed the whole Christian year save for Sunday and Easter” (Forrester 473). Following the most radical trends in the Protestant Reformation, the Presbyterian church insisted that worship practices be kept simple and focused upon a simple and unadorned proclamation of Christian doctrine and ethics. Campbell returns to this theme toward the end of his sermon as well, noting that in the Presbyterian assembly, “as to the *ceremonial* part, in itself simple, decent, masculine, no vain *parade* of childish jingle and trumpery, we both represent it in our doctrine, and render it in fact, in all respects *subordinate* and subservient to the *moral*” (62). Though Presbyterians of Campbell’s era maintained the practice of the Eucharist and thus some level of ceremony, they preferred it to be celebrated simply, without the elaborate ritual of the medieval Catholic tradition (Forrester 479). Campbell’s claim that this places the emphasis upon the moral elements of the service is accurate: with a reduced emphasis upon the sacramental acts of divine service, the preacher’s role was not so much to support the transformative performance of the sacrament, but to transform his hearers through the preaching alone. This was especially so since Reformed churches did not necessarily celebrate the Eucharist at every service (see Forrester 480). The service of the Word, culminating in the sermon, thus had higher importance for their church life.

Campbell’s more extended treatment of preaching in “The Character of a Minister” thus introduces a more Reformed emphasis into the history of preaching theory and sacred rhetoric, with its emphasis on doctrinal and moral knowledge over liturgical performance. As I argued above, we can thus see modern rhetoric’s reticence about materiality and the particularities of sacred rhetoric as arising not from a secular critique of religion, but in fact from religious disputes. Burke’s insistence upon the centrality of language, however secularized it may be, can be traced directly to Campbell’s radically Reformed doctrinal position. A retrieval of sacred rhetoric in the Enlightenment thus allows us to reckon with how deeply we are shaped even today in the secular field of rhetorical studies by the religious controversies of this period. Integrating sacred rhetoric back into the tradition can thus help us understand better not just religion, but our own discipline.

### American Hymnody and Protestant Social Imaginaries

Turning to the nineteenth century, the place of the sacred in the history of rhetoric shifts somewhat. IJsseling focuses on Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud, all of whom belong in any history of religion as well as rhetoric, yet he does not emphasize their work on religious themes. Bizzell and Herzberg, on the other hand, give more attention to sacred rhetoric in this period than any other, featuring preaching by Phoebe Palmer, preaching theory by Frances Willard, and other texts by Maria W. Stewart and Frederick Douglass that have significant religious components. Though these texts are considered primarily as instances of women’s and African-American rhetoric, Bizzell and Herzberg do credit “the spread of Protestant Christianity” with aiding women to achieve standing as orators (987). Though numerous other instances of nineteenth-century could be included, Bizzell and Herzberg’s selection shows this period of rhetorical history to be more open at the outset to the inclusion of resources drawn from religious tradition. However, Bizzell and Herzberg seem to view the drive for social justice they identify in rhetoric of the period as distinct from its religious impulses, as they comment that among their agenda for political justice women “retained a religious orientation” and therefore spoke in a religious idiom (987). For Bizzell and Herzberg, the religious views of figures like Stewart and Palmer are incidental to their political action for women’s rights. However, when these preachers are set within the tradition of sacred rhetoric, it becomes clear that the sacred is not a secondary aspect of their work, but essential to it.

I will demonstrate the value of sacred rhetoric to nineteenth-century social action by examining a rhetorical resource complementary to the texts Bizzell and Herzberg selected: Protestant hymnody and sacred music. The sacred texts Bizzell and Herzberg include, including all of Palmer, Willard, Stewart, and Douglass, draw on the nineteenth-century tradition of religious revivalism: an emotive and activist style of Protestant religion carried on at meetings outside traditional church structures, characteristic of the Second Great Awakening in the United States. Revival movements drew staggering numbers of people to camp meetings where popular preachers exhorted them to “revive” their faith with new dedication and enthusiasm: the most famous such meeting, at Cane Ridge, Kentucky, in 1801, saw from ten to twenty-five thousand people experiencing an “‘outpouring of the Spirit’” upon hearing the preaching of the gospel, including bodily convulsions (Willimon 101-102). Preaching and hymn singing were “paramount” to these movements (Willimon 102), to the extent that the most popular religious leaders of the period traveled with a music leader, such as evangelist Dwight L. Moody with his companion Ira Sankey (Blumhofer, “Fanny Crosby, William Doane” 154). This religious enthusiasm was characteristic of Protestant groups like the Methodists, Disciples of Christ, and Pentecostals, and encouraged not only an emotive style of worship but social activism, leading to the association of these evangelical groups with movements for abolition, temperance, and women’s rights. Palmer, Willard, Stewart, and Douglass all in their varying ways draw upon a background in these movements. If the hymnody of the period also manifests a concern for social action and supports a justice-oriented social imaginary, we may be required to rethink the relationship between religion and politics in these rhetoricians.

Sacred music in America in the nineteenth century was unusually dynamic, including many styles of music from the classically-informed church music of Lowell Mason, modeled on European choral traditions (Westermeyer 266), to the folk tradition of spirituals, most associated with African Americans but also prevalent among rural whites and even the Pennsylvania Dutch (Westermeyer 282, 285).[^55] For understanding the sacred music that would likely have accompanied speakers like Palmer or Douglass, however, the popular gospel music of the day is the best place to look. This musical tradition, which drew on folk traditions as well as the emerging commercial music scene, was most associated with revivalist preachers and musicians like Moody and Sankey (Blumhofer, “Fanny Crosby, William Doane,” 154). For an exemplary practitioner of the gospel music genre, I will consider Fanny Crosby, a late nineteenth-century (1820-1915) poet and writer of popular gospel hymn texts with a variety of composers. Crosby’s hymns were enormously popular, and continue to have a major presence in the hymn repertoires of revivalist Protestant denominations. Understanding the function of Crosby’s work will thus help us better understand the rhetorical affordances of the nineteenth-century revival in total, complementing our grasp of the rhetorical value of the period’s oratory.

Fanny Crosby was a lifelong New Yorker from a middle-class Protestant family. She was blinded by a failed medical procedure within the first year of her life, thus barring her from a conventional education as a child, but she proved to possess a “remarkable memory” and memorized large amounts of the Bible and poetry (Blumhofer, “Fanny Crosby,” 216-17). When she was fifteen, her mother enrolled her in the New York Institute for the Blind in New York City, where she received a more systematic education as well as musical training including the piano, organ, harp, and guitar (Blumhofer, “Fanny Crosby,” 218). Though Crosby was raised in a Presbyterian church of Puritan sensibilities, as an adult she attended a spectrum of Protestant churches, including Episcopal, Baptist, and Dutch Reformed, as well as the revivalist Charles Finney’s Broadway Tabernacle (Blumhofer, “Fanny Crosby,” 218-19). Her most notable religious experience, however, came in the Methodist church, where in 1850 she experienced the emotional certainty of salvation emphasized by that movement, in which she felt, as her autobiography described it, that her “very soul was flooded with a celestial light” (qtd. in Blumhofer, “Fanny Crosby,” 219). Though Crosby had written poems to be set to music as early as her time at the New York Institute, she began to come into her own in 1864 when she was introduced to the composer William Bradbury, one of her major collaborators. Over the remainder of her life, she published thousands of hymns with Bradbury and other partners, dictating them to a variety of amanuenses. Her work became so popular that toward the end of her life many Protestant churches set aside Sundays near her March 24 birthday as Fanny Crosby Sundays, in which the congregations gave thanks for her work and sung her hymns (Blumhofer, “Fanny Crosby,” 168). Despite her fame, Crosby did not grow wealthy on her compositions, and she spent much of her life in poorer areas of New York City engaged in service at the city’s rescue missions, preaching to and praying with trolley car operators, prostitutes, and sailors (Blumhofer, “Fanny Crosby, William Doane,” 222). While exceptional, then, Crosby’s life thus resonated with many of the themes of revivalist American Protestantism, including an emotive piety, freedom from traditional ecclesial structures, and social actions.

In order to illustrate the rhetorical effects of Crosby’s spirituality as expressed in her hymns, two of her most famous texts may prove illustrative. The first, “Blessed Assurance,” is likely Crosby’s best-known work—it continues to be widely sung in churches, and has been performed widely by musicians including country star Alan Jackson. Crosby wrote the text to a tune by Phoebe Palmer, the daughter of the Phoebe Palmer anthologized in Bizzell and Herzberg, and the text has remained wholly associated with that music ever since (“Blessed Assurance”). It reads as follows:[^56]

> Blessed assurance; Jesus is mine!    
> Oh, what a foretaste of glory divine!    
> Heir of salvation, purchase of God,    
> born of his Spirit, washed in his blood.
>
> *Refrain*:    
> This is my story, this is my song,    
> praising my Savior all the day long;    
> this is my story, this is my song,    
> praising my Savior all the day long.
>
> Perfect submission, perfect delight,    
> visions of rapture now burst on my sight;    
> angels descending bring from above    
> echoes of mercy, whispers of love. [Refrain]    
>
> Perfect submission, all is at rest,    
> I in my Savior am happy and blest;    
> watching and waiting, looking above,    
> filled with his goodness, lost in his love. [Refrain]

From its first line proclaiming personal ownership of Christ, “Blessed Assurance” proclaims a piety distinctive to its era. Ancient and medieval hymns tend toward corporate pronouns and a sense of the collective church gathered before God: for instance, the widely known Latin hymn “Te Deum Laudamus” begins “We praise you, O God” and proceeds to summon images of hosts of angels and saints gathered in worship (“Te Deum Laudamus”). In contrast, Crosby’s text makes heavy use of the first person singular possessive, producing a sense of intimacy if not familiarity with the Lord. Though the hymn retains a sense of the majesty and glory of God in the third verse with “angels descending,” that experience comes to the singular speaker and fills a part of “my story” alone. Whereas the older hymn stresses the praise given to God by the gathering of his people, Crosby’s text relates a private experience of devotion.

Moreover, the speaker’s private spiritual experience is significant for its emotional effect. Though Crosby does not fail to characterize the speaker’s position in doctrinal terms as one who is “washed in his blood,” the ultimate implication of this spiritual status in the final stanza is to be “happy and blest.” The Methodist Holiness Movement of Crosby’s time stressed that believers should have an inward, personal sense of conversion, an emotional experience that testified to the certainty of one’s salvation. Crosby herself had such an experience in 1850 (Blumhofer, “Fanny Crosby,” 219). “Blessed Assurance” accordingly speaks of such an experience. For Christians who share this evangelical background, to sing the hymn would thus involve being reminded of the original fervor of one’s individual conversion. Palmer’s simple, swelling tune aims to reinforce this refreshed experience of emotion. Crosby in fact wrote the text after hearing Palmer’s music, stating that “I felt . . . the air and the hymn were intended for each other” (from *Fanny Crosby’s Memories,* qtd. in “Blessed Assurance”). The sentiments of joyful confidence in the text thus arise in some measure from the music’s expression of that confidence. As a typical folk tune of the period, it is readily singable by untrained voices, with the melody straying barely outside an octave and no complex rhythms or interweaving of voices. The refrain uses a relatively limited number of simple chords, repeated several times. This simplicity means the tune can be quite emotionally engaging for the congregation, who can sing with energy and confidence without paying too much attention to intricate vocal patterns.[^57] This musical simplicity supports a text that is quite expressive and personal in its emotional language, stressing the experience of a first-person singular narrator: “I in my Savior am happy and blest.”" This expressiveness may again be contrasted with older hymnody: though ancient and medieval hymns are not devoid of emotional language, they tend to stress the worthiness of God over the feelings of the congregation. The ancient Greek text “O Gracious Light” (*Phos hilaron*), for instance, concludes:

> thou art worthy at all times    
> to be praised by happy voices,    
> O Son of God, O Giver of life,    
> and to be glorified through all the worlds. (“O Gracious Light.”)

Here the stress is placed upon the worthiness of Christ, who deserves praise from the voices of the saints, rather than the experience of happiness in the worshippers. Crosby’s emotional language thus reflects a significantly different style in Christian piety from older hymnody.

Analysis of Crosby’s individualized and emotive tendencies in “Blessed Assurance” could give the appearance of a rather narcissistic religion, yet looking to another of her best-known hymns should dispel that concern somewhat. Her text “Rescue the Perishing” reflects Crosby’s work as a companion of the poor. Again, it is worth giving the full text:

> Rescue the perishing, care for the dying,    
> snatch them in pity from sin and the grave;    
> weep o’er the erring one, lift up the fallen,    
> tell them of Jesus, the mighty to save.
>
> *Refrain*: Rescue the perishing,    
> care for the dying;    
> Jesus is merciful,    
> Jesus will save. 
>
> Though they are slighting Him, still He is waiting,    
> waiting the penitent child to receive;    
> plead with them earnestly, plead with them gently.    
> He will forgive if they only believe. [Refrain]
>
> Down in the human heart, crushed by the tempter,    
> feelings lie buried that grace can restore;    
> touched by a loving heart, wakened by kindness,    
> chords that are broken will vibrate once more. [Refrain]
>
> Rescue the perishing, duty demands it.    
> Strength for thy labor the Lord will provide;    
> back to the narrow way patiently win them,    
> tell the poor wanderer a Savior has died. [Refrain]

This text reflects well the impulse toward social action of Crosby’s religion, as well as its evangelistic fervor. Crosby links together spiritual and physical maladies by stressing that souls must be rescued from “sin and the grave,” espousing confidence that an experience of Christ will heal the penitent and restore the sinner. Crosby’s experience with prostitutes and sailors, the lower class of her time and place, echoes in the language of “poor wanderer” or “the fallen” whom the Christian must reach. As with “Blessed Assurance,” the tune by William H. Doane offers a rousing, singable melody meant to inspire the congregation singing it with a desire to act. Its steady rhythm and simple, repeated chords communicate a sense of motion and striving to do the work described in Crosby’s words. Though the text undoubtedly espouses a rather bourgeois and paternalistic morality—the text assumes that those who sing it are not among those perishing, but those with “duty” to save—in the context of nineteenth century religion it reflects a nascent concern for social justice that aligns with the preaching and social action of figures like Palmer and Douglass. Though contemporary readers may not find Crosby’s emphasis upon spiritual solutions to material problems entirely congenial, in the context of nineteenth-century sacred rhetorics, “Rescue the Perishing” undoubtedly draws upon the spirituality of social action evident in many of the era’s preachers, and it can thus be understood as a strong musical complement to the preaching of the time.

Crosby’s hymnody, read alongside the preaching that Bizzell and Herzberg anthologize, provides significant insight into the social imaginary of evangelical Protestants in the nineteenth and early twentieth century. Shaped not just by the novel experience of hearing preaching from figures like Palmer and Douglass but by singing hymns like “Blessed Assurance” and “Rescue the Perishing,” evangelical spirituality turned toward individualism and activism. Whereas older hymnody emphasizes the communal role of Christians as worshippers of God within the walls of the sanctuary, Crosby’s hymns carry the Protestant imagination outside the church, depicting a relationship with God in which “the individual never disappears” (Bohlman 13). Supported by the individual experience of God, the Christian as imagined in Crosby’s hymns is empowered to step out into the world and participate in social action, for the locus of spirituality lies not within the sanctuary but within the self. The revivalist and activist preaching of the era, significantly, also largely took place outside churches, in public halls (see Bizzell and Herzberg’s description of Maria W. Stewart’s speaking, 1033) and revival meetings (Bizzell and Herzberg 1089). For Protestant evangelicals, operating in ecclesial bodies that generally rejected the authority of the Pope, bishops, or any church hierarchy beyond the local congregation, such an individualizing of piety was not only possible, but a necessary way to show one’s devotion. Faithful religion, for these believers, lay not in communal, institutional acts such as participation in the sacraments or adherence to the doctrine set forth by the bishop, but in how one acted out one’s own, personal “blessed assurance” in daily life. Accordingly, the sacred rhetoric of the period undergirded what Taylor calls the “drive for democracy,” with evangelical religion an “anti-hierarchical force” supporting the increasing social consciousness and individualism of the time (*SA,* 451). Far from a vestigial ideological structure that women and African-Americans merely “retained” in their search for justice, in the nineteenth century sacred rhetoric served as a vital rhetorical resource in communities based around social action.

### Modern Catechesis and Enchantment

Turning to the twentieth century, we find histories of rhetoric mainly concerned with the theoretical revival of rhetoric associated with continental philosophy and linguistic theory. IJsseling engages with Hegel, Heidegger, and Foucault, while Bizzell and Herzberg anthologize Bakhtin, Burke, Perelman, Derrida, Cixous, and others. Whereas their coverage of the nineteenth century includes various popular sources in the orators of the period, Bizzell and Herzberg’s selections for modernism and postmodernism draw on academic and theoretical sources exclusively. The material is largely concerned with the traditional subjects of the linguistic turn in theory: language, power, and knowledge; race, class, and gender. In terms of sacred rhetoric, Bizzell and Herzberg do include Richard Weaver’s “Language is Sermonic,” but omit Burke’s *RR* and do not include the significant discussions of religion carried on by poststructuralist thinkers, whether Derrida’s late works on religion or writings by Rene Girard, Jean-Luc Marion, and others. Undeniably, then, there is a profusion of theoretical work on sacred rhetoric that could be considered by a new history of rhetoric.

For my treatment here, however, I will follow Bizzell and Herzberg’s example from their section on the nineteenth century and engage with what might be called a popular or folk sacred rhetoric. Throughout this history, my emphasis has been not upon rhetorical scholarship and theory—valuable as such work is—but upon approaches to forming the social imaginary of a group of people through action, language, and aesthetics. In the twentieth century, the need for such imaginative formation takes on new urgency with the growth of secularism, seen by many if not all religious leaders as a threat to their movements. The crossing out of God and the experience of cross pressure, identified by Latour and Taylor, are felt acutely in religious movements from the early part of the period, as demonstrated in my prior discussions of Burke, C. S. Lewis, and Bethel Church. I will thus conclude this history with a consideration of one highly disciplined attempt to counteract these secularizing trends, a program of religious education for children called the Catechesis of the Good Shepherd, founded in the 1950’s by Sofia Cavalletti and Gianna Gobbi and carried on today by an international organization.

The Catechesis of the Good Shepherd draws upon the educational principles of the influential Italian educator Maria Montessori to promote Catholic doctrine and practice among young children. Cavalletti and Gobbi began their work on the Catechesis in 1954, and they collaborated on its development for more than 50 years (Episcopal News Service). Cavalletti was a scholar of the Hebrew Bible, while Gobbi was trained in Montessori’s educational methods, which places a particular stress upon the teaching environment as well as freedom within limits for children. In applying Montessorian methods to religious education, Cavalletti and Gobbi stress that they are not adapting a secular method for the church, but are rather drawing out the natural implications of Montessori’s methods, which draw upon her own Catholic faith and have at their center “the sense of the sacred” (10). Their work is first articulated in the coauthored book *Teaching Doctrine and Liturgy,* and finds its best-known expression in Cavalletti’s *The Religious Potential of the Child.* Organizations promoting the Catechesis of the Good Shepherd exist worldwide (the American organization can be found at “Catechesis of the Good Shepherd USA” website), and it has achieved widespread use in churches, particularly Roman Catholic but also Anglican.[^58] As a program meant to teach the Christian faith to children and strengthen them in their devotion, the Catechesis must be understood as a deeply rhetorical project. In particular, my account will show it to offer a sacred rhetoric conversant with rhetorical history, shaped by concerns with orientation and person-giving, and particularly adapted to the realities of living in a secular age as diagnosed by Charles Taylor.

The Catechesis of the Good Shepherd is so called because of its focus on the figure of Christ the Good Shepherd, drawn from the parable of the Good Shepherd in John 10:1-16. Cavalletti notes that a catechetical method may be theocentric (focused on God the Father), anthropocentric (focused on the needs of the child), or Christocentric, which she sees as optimal for its relationship with the church year and stress on the incarnate relationship between God and humanity (62). The Catechesis begins with the story of the Good Shepherd, presented without moralizing additions as a symbolic and allusive text. For Cavalletti, the parable proclaims “above all the personal love and protective presence of the Good Shepherd: He calls each one of His sheep by name” (65). Resonances with the image of Christ the Good Shepherd thus appear in “the Eucharistic presence, the infancy and paschal narratives, the Easter liturgy of light, and the sacrament of baptism”—in short, through the whole life of the church (65). It also takes on new meanings as a subject of reflection for children throughout their development, and the method calls for returning to the parable from the earliest periods of catechesis (age three or even younger) to the completion of the process (ages ten to twelve). Alongside the central image of the Good Shepherd, the Catechesis stresses the symbolism of the liturgy and an allegorical (or at least highly allusive) reading of Scripture in what Cavalletti calls “the method of signs,” the use of parables, symbolism, images, and gestures as the primary teaching method rather than just didactic language (158). Cavalletti sees symbolism as deepening the child’s ability to perceive the transcendent and perceive the invisible realities of the faith (158). Rather than stressing memorization of facts or a didactic style of moral formation, the Catechesis attempts to help children dwell imaginatively within the rich historic symbolism of the Christian faith, especially as expressed in the liturgy and in the parables of Jesus. The central lessons of the curriculum are thus drawn from the parables of Jesus, the parable of the Good Shepherd (John 10) being the signal example, rather than from systematic theology or doctrine.

The other most distinctive aspect of the Catechesis is its emphasis upon the learning environment, where it draws much from Montessorian theories. Cavalletti and Gobbi insist upon the need for a specially designed sacred space for religious instruction, which they term (following Montessori) the “atrium,” after the space in a Roman house used for instruction of catechumens in the early church (37). The atrium must be specially designed for children, placing materials on a level where children can access them and scaling all furniture to their needs in order to minimize frustration and promote a sense of order and control (Cavalletti and Gobbi 39). The atrium will typically feature many low shelves full of items meant to facilitate both the work of the teacher and active participation by the children (see Figure 2).

<span id="_Toc501100976" class="anchor"></span>*Figure 2: A Catechesis of the Good Shepherd atrium, from a public domain image by Wairarapa Past Catechesis of the Good Shepherd, St Andrew’s in the Paddock, Masterton (20280717059), https://www.flickr.com/photos/wairarapapast/20280717059/.*

The materials included in the atrium are specially designed for the Catechesis, and the method emphasizes the use of “beautiful, high-quality materials” to communicate to children an “unspoken message of respect, care and love” (“Starting a Godly Play Program”). The Catechesis and its Anglican equivalent, Godly Play, have thus given rise to cottage industries to handcraft materials for their lessons, including in the USA (Godly Play Resources, Ashland, Kansas), England (St. Michael’s Workshop, Bowthorpe, Norwich), and Germany (Lindenwerkstätten, Leipzig). The resources are made of natural materials and handcrafted with great care, often to custom specifications.

The catechist or teacher will begin a session using the materials to tell the day’s story. In keeping with the “method of signs,” the stories are not overly determined in their meaning or didactic, but highly allusive and exploratory—the catechist asks numerous questions and seems to discover the methods with the children. The YouTube video “‘Parable of the Good Shepherd’ Godly Play” offers an example of the curriculum’s key story, told by Ryan Campbell, a Godly Play trainer. Campbell slowly removes the materials for the story from a golden box, looking at each in turn and considering what it might be. His diction is measured and contemplative, and the phrase he speaks more than any other is “I wonder.” Once the story is set up, Campbell relates the parable, but in a distinctive manner emphasizing the imaginative possibilities of the story. Rather than “telling a Bible story” or aiming to teach about Jesus, the story simply proceeds as a story: “I am the Good Shepherd. And I know each of my sheep by name. When I take them from the sheepfold, I show them the way.” Rather than drawing on doctrinal language, Campbell uses simple, descriptive words, loaded with symbolism: wolves and sheep, water and pasture, the shepherd and the way. The symbolism is not overdetermined but left to be interpreted by the audience, as Campbell concludes not with a lesson but wonder: “I wonder if you’ve ever been in a place like this.” The central catechetical event, then, is not doctrinal instruction or a moral lesson, but profoundly evocative storytelling. After the story is complete, children are given their own work to do with the materials, which can include artwork done with high-quality materials, or opportunities to explore liturgical and symbolic materials (see Figure. 3).

The atrium thus is not designed so much as a conventional educational environment, but a sacred space, emphasizing beauty and contemplation as well as a method of worship and work centered on the needs of the child. Like a cathedral, it has symbolic and ritual functions as well as a didactic purpose. The Catechesis thus aims to persuade through aesthetics and materiality in much the same manner as the traditional Christian liturgy, though with a special emphasis on children. The assembly of the children in the atrium thus seeks to foster not a grasp of complex systems of transcendence, but a Burkean orientation: a coherent way of interpreting certain signs in keeping with the outlook of the church. Children are not instructed in the doctrine and teachings of the church so as to grasp them intellectually, but they are shaped—through aesthetics and materiality as well as language—to have an imaginative orientation toward the ends of the liturgy and the Christian life. As children grow through the curriculum, they will receive more explicit doctrinal and intellectual instruction, but always shaped by the orientation fostered early in their lives (as soon as age three) by the imaginative and symbolic resources of the Catechesis. Cavalletti’s method thus aims to create an orientation that will continue to resonate with children imaginatively and emotionally as they grow toward maturity.

The Catechesis draws upon the tradition of sacred rhetoric as I have outlined it both implicitly and explicitly. Its implicit use of the tradition can be seen in its liturgical influences, which allow it to draw on the liturgical rhetoric with which I began this history. In its conviction the Scriptures draw believers (including children) nearer to God and its reliance upon the imaginative resources of the sacraments, the Catechesis is deeply shaped by the rhetorical affordances of the liturgy. Cavalletti and Gobbi also draw upon the tradition explicitly, however, most notably in their theory of audience. The Catechesis places a strong emphasis upon allowing children to learn themselves, directing the catechist to ask questions and allow free exploration of the learning environment “so that God may unfold His truths in a personal colloquium with His disciple” (Cavalletti and Gobbi 40). They cite Augustine in support of this principle that a teacher may show the way, but coming to faith and knowledge of the truth can only be done by the student (Cavalletti and Gobbi 40). And indeed, in the various ways that the Catechesis seeks to adapt the practice of faith to the needs and experience of children, it can be seen as an especially thoroughgoing version of the adaptation to the audience practiced by Augustine and Gregory, as a sacred rhetoric particularly committed to person-giving. By respecting the ability of children to make connections and learn for themselves when presented with Scripture and tradition, the Catechesis aims to make God present to the children—not through instruction but through an encounter with the sacred, one that extends respect to the audience as interpreters of symbolism. The Catechesis thus extends the person-giving tradition of sacred rhetoric both in its liturgical and audience-focused emphases.

The materiality of the Catechesis reflects its roots in liturgical worship, but also can be seen as a unique adaptation to the conditions of secularism as described by Taylor. For Taylor, the disenchantment of modernity is largely about “the immanent frame,” in which all of existence must necessarily possess a fully immanent rationale, with the transcendent bracketed at best (*SA,* 542). In this regime, the goal of any human activity—including education—must be accountable in immanent terms, as aimed at human flourishing (*SA,* 16). Accordingly, education must have tangible goals and work toward those goals using scientific, rational methods. Students instructed within such a system are trained to act and think within the immanent frame, even if the material they cover touches on the transcendent—they can believe only in the crossed-out God, as Latour would put it. The Catechesis, however, attempts to step outside this secularized program to produce children with, at least, what Taylor would call an “open take” on modernity, providing at least some possibility for enchantment (*SA* 553). The program’s emphasis on materiality and beauty ground this attempt. Whereas immanent modernity tends toward an emphasis on information, language, and knowledge in a process of “excarnation” (*SA* 741), the Catechesis foregrounds the body: not only through liturgical actions, but by recognizing that the particular bodies of children matter, and working to accommodate their size (with smaller furniture) and physical needs (by allowing free movement around the classroom). Moreover, by stressing a beautiful setting, good quality materials, and space for quiet and contemplation, the Catechesis creates a sacred space meant to convey an aesthetic, imaginative sense of the presence of the divine. Materials from the Catechesis speak to this sense of the sacred in several places. Cavalletti and Gobbi state that children who leave the atrium “carry with them the *enchantment* which they have tasted in drawing near to God,” which allows them to evangelize others with their example (56, emphasis mine). Cavalletti herself is thinking in Taylor’s terms.[^59] Even more interesting is a video put out by the United States organization supporting the Catechesis, which begins with this text, slowly revealed on a black background:

> We long for joy    
> for beauty    
> for love    
> But do we make space for it in our lives? (“3 Minute CGS Video.”)

The video then cuts to a scene of a busy city from overhead and voiceover from an interview with Mary Mirrione, National Director of the Catechesis of the Good Shepherd, who speaks of the hectic nature of modern life and the need for children to “find a place where they can just be” (“3 Minute CGS Video”). Clearly, then, much of what the supporters of the Catechesis see as its value comes from the sense of enchantment they find in it, in contrast with the constant pressure of immanent concerns in modern life. The methods of orientation and person-giving on offer in the liturgy and the Catechesis thus have value in how they offer believers the opportunity to uncross the crossed-out God: by submerging themselves imaginatively in these systems that aim to create a holistic orientation toward life and a person-giving encounter with God is seen as a way of overcoming modernity’s fragmentation and impersonalism. A life of orientation toward God and person-giving encounter with him, on this view, would be one that escapes, to some degree, the immanent frame. Fostering a symbolic orientation and a person-giving attitude toward the divine, sacred rhetoric thus comes to be seen as powerful response to disenchantment through the liturgical traditions of the church. Whether or not the Catechesis of the Good Shepherd is ultimately successful in this nonmodern attempt to achieve enchantment, the program represents a creative engagement with the tradition of sacred rhetoric and the challenges of modernity, making it well worth further examination by scholars of those subjects.

### Conclusion

Throughout this dissertation, I have argued that rhetorical studies must take seriously sacred rhetoric, using the method of speculation to produce a theory of sacred rhetoric which takes religion seriously as a source of rhetorical theory. Such an approach is beneficial not just because it does justice to religious thinkers and texts, but because it will enrich rhetorical studies as such. As this brief history has suggested, sacred rhetorics—from the *Didache* to the Catechesis of the Good Shepherd—resonate with the most compelling theoretical work being done in the field and add productive complexity to our historical understanding. Ultimately, there ought to be no wall of separation between the full-scale history of rhetoric and that of sacred works, for understanding sacred rhetorics provides, at least, a necessary context for much of that history, from Augustine to Campbell to nineteenth-century preachers. Moreover, as I have shown, sacred rhetorics provide compelling insights on general rhetorical topoi like audience, ethos, embodiment, and imagination. Rhetoricians thus ought not to view engaging with sacred rhetoric as an obligation foisted upon them by an airtight critique, but as an opportunity to expand the discipline and enrich their understanding.

I began this dissertation with Margaret D. Zulick’s charge that sacred rhetoric represents an “immense undiscovered country” (125). My brief counter-history maps only the smallest portion of that country, leaving much of the rest—Jewish and Islamic rhetorics, non-western religions, sacred architecture—still marked *terra incognita.* As our accounts of the history of rhetoric continue to evolve, I look forward to other explorations, doubtless from a quite different entry point, into this new frontier of the discipline.

Within rhetorical studies, reference Laurent Pernot: “Given recent progress in the history of rhetoric and religious studies, the moment is propitious to explore the intersections between rhetoric and religion” (236).

[^2]: A note on terminology: though I will venture into definitions and rationale somewhat later in this chapter, let the reader note that my dissertation prefers the term “sacred rhetoric,” and thus when I use the term “rhetoric of religion” it refers to the traditional approach of the discipline, derived in particular from Burke. For further discussion of terminology, see my discussion of definitions below.

[^3]: I am indebted to religion journalist Terry Mattingly for the “get religion” language, which he draws from William Schneider: see Mattingly’s site, GetReligion.org.

[^4]: See, for example, two surveys of religious communication by D. Ray Heisey and Em Griffin in the *Journal of Communication and Religion* 21 (1998), which, while providing able summaries of the field, do little to address the lack of concepts and tools I have identified. Indeed, Griffin bemoans a lack of theoretical reflection, stating that “many atheoretical studies” have appeared in the discipline, yet his work does not redress this issue (133).

[^5]: Similar to Zulick’s approach to the subject is Michael Souders’s bibliographical article on “Religious Rhetoric” for Oxford Bibliographies, although a topical approach is perhaps understandable for a bibliographic essay. Souders’s treatment of the subject is useful in its interdisciplinary scope and wide range of materials covered, but goes over no ground not covered by Zulick or other essays I discuss here. Similarly, a recent and much welcome edited collection by Elizabeth Vander Lei et al. from the University of Pittsburgh Press, *Renovating Rhetoric in Christian Tradition*, restricts itself to specific, topical areas.

[^6]: In addition to Pernot’s categories, I could add such major genres as the jeremiad (discussed by Zulick and in Sacvan Bercovitch’s *The American Jeremiad*), as well as neglected but fascinating species of religious rhetoric such as the tract, the church marquee, and televangelism.

[^7]: Luigi Spina, for example, categorizes religious rhetorical acts by speaker and addressee—an intriguing way to proceed, but ultimately a limiting one with little room for non-verbal rhetorics.

[^8]: See also Charlotte Allen, “Is Nothing Sacred?”

[^9]: See Latour, *Reassembling the Social*, 2; Bennett, *Vibrant Matter,* 21.

[^10]: The classical and modern/postmodern periods are each allotted more than 400 pages, the Renaissance receives over 200, but the thousand-year span of the Middle Ages merits only 120 pages.

[^11]: Conley’s book, though perhaps the best treatment of medieval rhetoric in a general historical survey, verges on reducing the period to a Ciceronian-Boethian dialectic; Copeland and Sluiter treat “secular” rhetorics well, but almost wholly neglect preaching; Murphy has other theoretical problems, such as a hostility to sophism and an insufficient account of the contributions of religion (see Murphy 35).

[^12]: A framework which, for Latour, includes postmodernity.

[^13]: For an elegant elaboration of how the division between secular and religious fails, see Wayne Booth’s exposition of Kenneth Burke in “Kenneth Burke’s Religious Rhetoric: ‘God-Terms’ and the Ontological Proof.”

[^14]: Latour, *On the Modern Cult of the Factish Gods,* 101.

[^15]: A tradition of thought understanding the material as active and vital rather than passive and mechanical.

[^16]: For some first steps toward consideration of rhetorics from other sacred traditions, see my coauthored bibliography with Paul Lynch, “Twenty-five Years of Faith in Writing: Religion and Composition, 1994-2017,” *Present Tense* 6.2 (2017).

[^17]: Timothy W. Crusius does discuss a possible connection between Bultmann and Burke briefly, noting a potentially shared perspective on onto-theology and ultimately rejecting it because Bultmann was more explicitly aligned with Christianity (122). Saying that Bultmann and Burke do not share a metaphysical project, however, does not invalidate the point that they share a critical method.

[^18]: This mirrors the modern crossing out of God diagnosed by Latour: see *WHNBM* 33.

[^19]: Interestingly, Crusius argues that in his desire to transform philosophy, Burke is closer to Taylor than Derrida, and he argues that connections between Burke and Taylor should be further explored (2, 229). However, Crusius’s language-focused account of Burke does not suggest such an alignment, as Taylor is careful to avoid privileging language.

[^20]: Debra Hawhee has also drawn out Burke’s connections with Nietzsche in a compelling article for the *Quarterly Journal of Speech*; although, like Crusius, she stresses his attention to language, she also notes themes related to materiality such as his resistance to “the mechanistic perspective” (“Burke and Nietzsche,” 140).

[^21]: Note how Rueckert picks up this usage in his own secular reading of Burke, suggesting that the natural/supernatural or empirical/theoretical binary is key to the secularization of dramatism/logology (245).

[^22]: Latour’s discussion of the “crossed-out God,” discussed in my introduction, articulates a similar binary in which modernity relies upon the bracketing of any notion of the supernatural (*WHNBM* 33).

[^23]: Moreover, as Taylor makes clear, even modern people aren’t nearly as free of the so-called supernatural as we would like to think, as evidenced by “unquiet frontiers of modernity” like experiences with death or the festive (711). This will bear more discussion in my chapter on Taylor later in this work.

[^24]: Burke’s notion of “secular conversion,” discussed earlier, could also potentially be fruitful here. However, I have chosen to focus on orientation as the broader term, one which encompasses Burke’s notion of conversion and provides a more expansive framework for analysis.

[^25]: And indeed, Lewis himself distances his account of his life from that of Augustine in his preface to *Surprised by Joy* (vii).

[^26]: The title derives from Wordsworth’s short lyric “Surprised by Joy”; it predates Lewis’s later marriage to Joy Gresham.

[^27]: Though it would be reasonable to question whether Lewis was an accurate guide to his own conversion, for the purposes of my argument what is important is not the details of Lewis’s biography but his understanding of conversion, drawn from his own experiences as well as his desires for his readers. David Jasper argues that Lewis’s use of his conversion narrative in *Surprised by Joy* is quintessentially rhetorical and “constitutes an invitation to every reader to identify with the protagonist and thus for his story to become particular to each reader” (233). Whether Lewis’s goal is to model a conversion that will help other readers or to accurately convey his own conversion does not matter so much—his rhetorical model of the conversion experience is the point, and this can be revealed through a reading of the autobiography itself.

[^28]: That is, an ontology that views all beings as existing equally; no being “is” more than another, including God. For elaboration on this term, see Levi R. Bryant, *The Democracy of Objects, 245.*

[^29]: Burke uses the term “discounting” to describe making modifications to an existing system of thought (such as Marxism), based on historical context or other facts, to make it usable again: “By proper discounting, *everything* becomes usable” (*Attitudes Toward History,* 244).

[^30]: See Murphy, 269-356; Carolyn Muessig, *Preacher, Sermon, and Audience in the Middle Ages*; and Siegfried Wenzel, *The Art of Preaching.* See also the many editions of medieval *artes praedicandi,* of which there are too many to list, but including Murphy’s edition of Robert of Basevorn’s *Forma praedicandi* in *Three Medieval Rhetorical Arts,* and the extensive collection of Wycliffite sermons edited by Anne Hudson.

[^31]: Most notably, see Richard Leo Enos and Roger Thompson, *The Rhetoric of St. Augustine of Hippo: De Doctrina Christiana and the Search for a Distinctly Christian Rhetoric.*

[^32]: See Ruth Abbey’s single-author volume of 2001 and edited collection of 2004, unhelpfully both simply titled *Charles Taylor*; also Tully and Weinstock and Nicholas H. Smith.

[^33]: See Cavanaugh, Colorado and Klassen, and James K.A. Smith.

[^34]: See Bretherton and Brown and Ainley.

[^35]: See Barnett.

[^36]: See Benner et al.

[^37]: See Gee.

[^38]: See Lupton.

[^39]: See Joustra and Wilkinson.

[^40]: See p. 11 of Toulmin’s *Cosmopolis* for an eloquent statement of this critique.

[^41]: See *Sources of the Self* 202-204 for a discussion of his views on historical causation.

[^42]: Taylor’s use of the term “Reformed” here is idiosyncratic, referring to movements that have been shaped by the large-scale historical process he terms the Reform Master Narrative (see *SA,* 773-776), rather than the more conventional meaning of Protestant, Calvinist movements.

[^43]: For instance: user @TadKosciuszko described Perdue’s actions as “an official rain dance,” @Charlie\_Corley called Perdue “Rain man” and “a joke,” and @rachelRACH10 exclaimed with incredulity: “Sonny Perdue prayed for rain. Literally. We’re doomed.”

[^44]: Others, of course, do reject the immanent frame to one degree or another, or experience it as a constraint—see *SA* 546. However, Taylor would say that few of us in the Western world can hope to escape its influence entirely. I will address points of greater resistance to it below.

[^45]: Bethel and its associated school, the Bethel School for Supernatural Ministry, received further skeptical coverage a year after Jones’s article in *BuzzFeed News*: see Molly Hensley-Clancy, “Meet The ‘Young Saints’ Of Bethel Who Go To College To Perform Miracles.”

[^46]: Indeed, many of the aspects of Bethel’s rhetoric observed above are standard approaches within churches influenced by the church growth movement within evangelicalism, which aims to make churches friendly and comfortable to those who are not accustomed to church. Rick Warren’s *The Purpose Driven Church* offers the most notable statement of these principles.

[^47]: See also Murphy, *Rhetoric in the Middle Ages,* 62; Conley, 77; Johnson; and Schaeffer.

[^48]: This can also be seen in the portions of *DDC* which have been historically understood to focus more on hermeneutics than rhetoric (though whether that distinction makes sense for Augustine is debatable). Augustine explains that even rigorous biblical interpretation fails if it does not build up love: “So anyone who thinks he has understood the divine scriptures or any part of them, but cannot by his understanding build up this double love of God and neighbour, has not yet succeeded in understanding them” (I.40.86, p. 27). The hermeneutic of charity thus informs a rhetoric of charity which has a concern for the ultimate good of the audience as its governing imperative.

[^49]: Plato certainly did not introduce it, to name Augustine’s other most important classical influence—note that in *Gorgias,* Socrates defines the audience for oratory as “those who don’t have knowledge” (459a, p. 17).

[^50]: Moreover, Campbell’s other major works were largely concerned with theological topics. Though now obscure, his *Lectures on Systematic Theology and Pulpit Eloquence* (1807) and *Lectures on the Pastoral Character* (1811) undoubtedly ought to be retrieved for future work on the history of sacred rhetoric (see Golden and Corbett 140).

[^51]: See Duncan B. Forrester, “The Reformed Tradition in Scotland,” *The Oxford History of Christian Worship,* 473: “A clean sweep, a radical break with the past, and a new beginning were the intention, and the worship of the medieval Church was denounced in its entirety as ‘idolatrie.’”

[^52]: Campbell here draws upon the classical rhetorical genres: judicial, deliberative, and epideictic, though he does not make this influence explicit.

[^53]: Quotations from the early edition of Campbell’s work have here been silently modernized by removing the long *s* and some additional printer’s marks. Spelling and most punctuation have been retained as in the original, including Campbell’s use of italics, which convey a sense of the oral nature of the piece.

[^54]: A puppet show or spectacle, with the implication of vulgar, lurid display. See “raree-show, *n.*”

[^55]: This is to say nothing of traditions in England and Europe, which were also sites of religious and musical ferment. Bizzell and Herzberg emphasize the American context in this period, however, suggesting that more work remains to be done on nineteenth-century sacred rhetorics in other cultures.

[^56]: Hymn texts are drawn from Calvin College’s online database *Hymnary.org,* an authoritative source that compiles data from hundreds of hymnals.

[^57]: I am grateful to Paul Dudrey for assistance with the musical analysis of Crosby’s hymns.

[^58]: Cavalletti’s student Jerome Berryman also developed an alternative version of the catechesis aimed at Anglican churches known as *Godly Play.* See the “Godly Play Foundation” website.

[^59]: I have found no evidence that Cavalletti knew Taylor’s work; though their careers overlapped chronologically, they moved in different academic worlds and his rise to interdisciplinary prominence came largely at the end of her life.
